# Social Semantics

## Introduction

The previous chapter discusses an individual's relation with their online representation; how the affordances of a profile impact the culture of an online community, including how users interact and relate to each other, and how users understand themselves as part of the community. The studies described consider profiles and users *within* individual systems, yet online representations of people are employed across different systems in great and exciting variety. In order to build on our understanding of the role an online profile plays in self-presentation, identity and interaction we need a more nuanced understanding of what a 'profile' *is* in a general sense. Our goal therefore is to establish a framework for classifying online profiles so that they may be more effectively compared despite the differences between systems and communities.



//, and how a 'profile' is situated in the context of its use

This chapter primarily examines existing implementations of social profiles, to find out what works and what's missing (compared to needs identified in ch2).
 Second we propose a set of constructs to
capture the most important features of social machines and
to compare existing instances thereof

Claim that 'profile' is defined simplistically in existing studies. To that end we undertake an empirical analysis of digital representations of users on 20 different social websites and derive a classification framework to enable profiles to be considered along different dimensions (or something).

## Background

### Describing people for computers

Data modelling and knowledge representation

* FOAF + Relationships
* VCard
* SIOC
* Person or webpage: who cares, does it matter, and httpRange-14 (it is at least worth mentioning if we're going to turn this work into something useful for pedantic engineers etc; the real question is: can I fit this discussion into a section in a chapter, or should I write a whole book on it?)

### User perceptions of profiles

Studies about what users feel they should put in a profile due to community norms, expectations, particular service. Or what users feel might be the consequences of how they use a profile. Particular outcomes of profile usage.

## Defining an online profile

What are potential variants in how profiles are formed which influence a community (and vice versa)?

### Method

* Study: Start with questions to answer about profiles on different sites; refine questions with progress; find overlaps, similarities, differences; turn this into a framework for categorisation/comparison of types of profile. Probably an actual named method for this.
* Justify selection of starting 20 sites
** Alexa?
** Social Machines classifications?
** Some dimensions to try to cover, like purpose, user base, business model, ..
** types of social media from a classification, eg. Kaplan & Haenlein 2010, White 2014
* Evaluation: apply taxonomy to more. Selection how?

### Limitations

* Western bias
* Frequency of changes

### Results

WIP:

* http://rhiaro.co.uk/2015/06/what-profile
* https://github.com/rhiaro/profiles/blob/master/study.md

(Maybe a summary/table, and raw results go in an appendix)

### Taxonomy

Something coherant and useful, hopefully.

### Evaluation

Apply taxonomy
