  <p>The goal of this thesis is to bridge established social science research about self-presentation and impression management, with a practical, developer-centric perspective on building social web applications. We seek to understand how and why contemporary social networking systems both help and hinder individual’s expressive needs, and what people do to work around technical and social constraints they encounter during day to day use. What we learn from this, we can use to optimise future social systems for individual and collective empowerment.</p>

  <p>This work is best situated in the field of Web Science, a multidisciplinary domain with a focus on the relationships between people and the technology that connects them. We draw particularly upon related work in digital sociology as well as computer science […]</p>

  <p>Throughout this work we describe and advocate for particular visions of systems and technologies that we believe to be best practice, however it is important to note that such systems are not an end in themselves. The social changes that technologies enable are what matters. Thus we emphasise that while digital technology is constantly evolving, and subject to rapidly shifting political and technological landscapes […] [peoples needs and desires and percieved rights are reconfigured by changing tech]</p>

  <p>We begin with a literature survey of fundamental ideas from social sciences about the presentation of self, as well as more recent early work from social and computer sciences (and media?) about how people use such systems to express themselves and connect with others. Grounded in this, we discuss the current state of the art of social networking sites (SNSs); in particular how they fail to meet–or even violate–users’ social needs, as indiciated by the ways in which users bypass the various constraints imposed upon them.</p>

  <p>In chapter 3 we discuss the concept of an online profile as a tool for self expression, and present the results of an empirical study of the features of profiles from 20 social tools. We conclude that what constitutes a suitable <em>profile</em> is context-dependant and varies with individual and community needs. We use the results of our study to build a taxonomy of online social profiles which can be used to describe and compare current systems and new ones as they emerge.</p>

  <p>Chapter 4 takes a brief look at the history of implementation and standardisation efforts for decentralised online social interactions, leading up to the present day contributions of the W3C Social Web Working Group. We present criteria for successful standards and contribute to  discuss the implications of the standards</p>
