  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The <a href="/thesis/chapter2">previous chapter</a> discusses an individual’s relation with their online representation; how users understand profiles; how the affordances of a profile impact the culture of an online community, including how users interact and relate to each other, and how users understand themselves as part of the community. We have established that there are various different (potentially overlapping) perspectives that need to be taken into account when discussion online self-presentation:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Active users of a system, who maintain a profile.</li>
    <li>Passive users of a system, who may not have a profile of their own.</li>
    <li>System designers and developers, who must model and display data about their users.</li>
    <li>Third-party developers who build additional services using data from another system.</li>
    <li>Regulatory bodies which seek to influence or direct how systems are used for legal, ethical or economic reasons.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We have conducted five empirical studies which touch on each of these perspectives to some degree. The results of the studies coalesced into a framework of five concepts which we are key for describing online self-expression experiences:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Control

    </ul></li>

      <li>privacy/surveillence</li>
      <li>unintended profiles built by third parties</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul>

  <p>This chapter describes the results from these studies in the context of this framework. Hinted at by [@boyd-facid, cite, cite, cite], individuals are rapidly and often intuitively developing coping mechanisms and practices to more effectively manage their online self-presentation and impression management despite the constraints of the tools they use. The first four studies focus on some of these behaviours through examining:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>deception and lying for impression management in mainstream social media.</li>
    <li>the personal branding of creative content producers on YouTube;</li>
    <li>social media 'makers' who control their social interactions through personal websites;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We posit that the technical constraints of a system has an impact on user perceptions of the system, and the culture of the community which uses it. The <a href="#what-is-a-profile">final study</a> asks the question "what is a profile?" and takes an objective look at 20 online systems which employ user profiles in a social capacity to classify their features.</p>

<section id="constructing-online-identity">

  <h2>Constructing online identity</h2>

  <p>This section has been adapted from work published as <em>Constructed Identity and Social Machines: A Case Study in Creative Media Production</em> (2014, Proceedings of WWW, Seoul).</p>

  <p>In {part x} we described existing work in understanding socio-technical systems as Social Machines, and argue that due to the complex nature of online identity, understanding nuanced identity behaviours of Social Machine participants in a more granular way is crucial. Here, we briefly describe <em>creative media production social machines</em>, and present the results of a study of personas portrayed by participants in one of these. We then describe additional dimensions along which a Social Machine can be classified in order to better understand human participants as individuals.</p>

  <p>Amongst the plethora of user-generated content on the web are a huge number of works of creative media, and behind these are independent content creators pushing their work to a global audience and actively seeking to further their reach. Within this ecosystem we can see <em>creative media production social machines</em> on a variety of different scales. The definition of creative media production social machines encompasses a broad class of systems where:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>humans may use a purely digital, or combination of digital and analogue methods, and a degree of creative effort, to produce media content;</li>
    <li>the content is published such that it is publicly accessible on the web;</li>
    <li>a global audience may consume, curate and commentate on this content in technologically-mediated environments.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These social machines exist both within and across content host platforms (eg. YouTube) and within and across online communities and social networks. Many, if not all, media types and genres are represented among the media artefacts that emerge from these systems, and the content combines with its reception to have a sometimes profound effect on media and culture in the offline world.</p>

  <p>Figure \ref{vlog} shows the interconnected social and technical systems engaged when a simple vlog (video blog) is uploaded to YouTube. These processes would be further expanded if the creator was to branch out and produce different types of content, collaborate with another creator, cross-publicise, share audiences or even co-own a YouTube channel or other website profile.</p>

  <p><img src="figs/fig_vlog.eps" alt="Interconnected social and technical systems necessary for publishing a vlog on YouTube.\label{vlog}" /></p>

  <p>Creative media production social machines create an environment in which content creators of all backgrounds and abilities are able to publish outside of the constraints of traditional media channels. These creators are actively vying for attention from the masses; competing for views, likes and shares on a global scale. How they present themselves to their audience can be critical to their success, but also a ground for playful experimentation.</p>

  <p><strong>Motivations for participation</strong></p>

  <p>It is worth noting that there are a variety of motivations or incentives for content creators to participate in these systems.</p>

  <p>Some content host sites provide direct financial incentive for popularity (eg. YouTube's Google Adsense). Others facilitate a commission based model, where creators show off their work and take paid requests for custom pieces from the community (eg. DeviantArt). For content creators who publish primarily on such systems, their activity on other systems is usually tied to driving traffic back to the content which makes them money, or entertaining the fanbase from whom they thrive (eg. a creator who publishes sketch comedy on YouTube might use their Twitter account to tell original jokes to maintain interest in between video releases).</p>

  <p>But for many content creators, the financial rewards from their chosen content host sites might be a convenient side-effect of doing something that they love. Reputation as a creator of high quality content, a talented artist or a particularly funny comedian might be their primary driver. There are also social cues in many communities that affect content creator behaviour. Sometimes creators don't want to be accused of 'pandering' to their audience or losing their artistic integrity, and regulate their behaviour accordingly.</p>

  <p>The visibility of quantitative data collected by a content host site – such as how many views a piece of content has, how often they are referred to as a co-creator, or how often a content creator persona responds to viewer comments – may also impact behaviour. Technical factors are often highly conflated with the social norms in a community.</p>

  <p>Thus, the core reasons for creating content can affect both the content created and how creators present themselves to their audience in the process.</p>

  <section id="context-and-research-questions">
    <h3>Context and research questions</h3>

    <p>The nature of identity and anonymity in online spaces is well discussed \cite{Donath2002, Halpin2006, Rains2007, Ren2012}. Humans naturally adjust the way they present themselves according to the context, and different online spaces may afford different levels of flexibility in doing this. Some systems don't require any kind of registration to post content, allowing people to adopt and discard personas as needed, and to create social cues to identify each other that are not designed as part of the system \cite{Bernstein2011}. Entirely different behaviour occurs in systems that strongly encourage or even try to enforce usage of real names. Often it is trivial for people to create multiple accounts under different pseudonyms anyway, but there may be an increased expectation of honesty from other users of the system, which itself affects the culture of communities within.</p>

    <p>In many cases the fact that people present themselves differently in different contexts is unconscious; a side effect of their participation in a particular system according to the social norms or technical affordances (eg.\ their desired username may be unavailable resulting in the forging of new branding around an alternative). In other cases, the creation of alternative personas is engineered and deliberate, either from the outset or as something that has evolved over time. But, beyond carefully crafting a single identity each, multiple individuals may participate in the portrayal of a single persona \cite{Dalton2013} and one individual may present versions of themselves through <em>multiple</em> personas.</p>
    
    <p>The public profiles of content creators were examined with the following questions in mind:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>How do content creators present themselves within and across communities?</li>
      <li>To what extent are content creators' online presences consistent platforms, and how is their content distributed across different online presences?</li>
      <li>How, and to what extent, do content creators present connections between their own online presences?</li>
    </ol> 
    <p>We also take note of their audience, the type of content they create, and the capabilities of the platforms on which they publish their content, to add context.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="study-design">
    <h3>Study design</h3>



    <h4 id="participants">Participants</h4>

    <p>Ten content creators were selected from a subset of creators with whose content we have a passing familiarity through encountering it online over the past months to years. This resulted in a broad spectrum of content types (video, animation, music, art, written word) genres (comedy, game commentaries, educational, political), popularity, well-knownness and activity levels. We deliberately examined content creator profiles from the perspective of a content consumer, or casual audience member. Thus, for the purposes of this study, we do not have access to deeper insight about the personas beyond what is accessible publicly through the web.</p>

  <section id="results">
    <h3>Results</h3>

    <p>The results presented here are based upon a very small (albeit diverse) sample, and cannot be considered representative of content creators in general.</p>

    <h4 id="profiles-and-personas">Profiles and personas</h4>

    <p>For ten content creators, 93 profiles were discovered. Of these, 23 were YouTube channels, 16 Twitter profiles, 13 Facebook, 9 Vimeo, 7 Tumblr, 6 personal websites, 5 Instagram and 4 Vine, 3 Google Plus, 2 Bandcamp and 2 DeviantArt and 1 each of Patreon, FormSpring, BlipTV, and Newgrounds. Table \ref{creators} shows how the profiles are distributed. As we can see, in the domain of creative content production identities are not site- or community-specific. Creators spread their activities across a number of networks in order to shape a more complete identity.</p>

    <p><strong>Table: Distribution of profiles for content creators in the study.</strong></p>

    <p>'Second channels' are common on YouTube. Creators who focus on one type of content (eg.\ sketch comedy) publish this on their main channel as well as using their main channel identity for interactions on the site. On their second channel they publish content that they may consider to be of interest to only a part of their main audience, such as vlogs about their lives, outtakes from main channel content, or experimental pieces. Most content creators with second channels post explicit links to them on their main channel, and often publicise them within content metadata or as part of the content directly. In some cases, including those where the connection between two channels is explicit and obvious, the creators behave differently towards their audience through second channel content. This varies greatly depending on the type of content produced. In some cases, second channels may be perceived as more reflective of the creator's 'true' personality, if they project themselves as more serious or honest, and publish more personal content like vlogs or behind-the-scenes footage. Whether or not this is accurate is impossible to know without intimate knowledge of the creators' offline life of course. The significance is that persona variations exist, and creators do not necessarily hide these alternative presentations of themselves from their audience.</p>

    <p>Additionally, there are profiles which are <em>not</em> directly linked from the (self-identified) 'main' profile, or the links are treated as though to the profile of a different person. Figure \ref{clinks} shows three screenshots of different YouTube channels showing different ways creators link out to other versions of themselves.</p>

    <p><img src="fig_channellinks.eps" alt="Dane transparently links to 3 of his channels, two for alternative content types and one for a character he created.  2. Fred is a character played by Lucas, but the links on Fred's channel treat Lucas as a different person. 3. Andrew Lemming lists Khyan as &quot;Uncle&quot;, although Khyan is the creator of the Andrew Lemming character. \label{clinks}" /></p>

    <p>Creators also used their profiles to link to shared channels (where either multiple creators post content independently of each other, or creators collaborate to produce joint content, or a both), and channels of others with whom they regularly work.</p>

    <p>Most profile host sites offer limited options for customisation, and the use of consistent branding was intermittent. This mostly took the form of identical or similarly styled display pictures, similarly phrased introductory paragraphs, and similarly styled content.</p>

    <p>Some creators have profiles which are distinctly grouped into alternative personas. This was evident from the branding, content and connections between them.</p>

    <h4 id="connections">Connections</h4>

    <!-- Todo: dig up actual results with connection counts and add them here -->

    <p>How connections to other people were represented varied depending on the technical system. We can differentiate between mutual relationships between accounts (eg. 'friend') and one-directional relationships (eg. 'follower', 'subscriber'). Some systems offer both types of relationship, some one or the other. For YouTube channels, popularity ranged from over 3.5 million subscribers for Dane's character channel <em>realannoyingorange</em> to 118 for Bown's secondary <em>bowntalks</em> channel.</p>

    <p>The importance of these connections varies depending on the system as well as on the attitude of the system user. Mutual connections may initially be presumed to indicate a closer relationship, but this is not always the case. Some systems allow users to accept all friend requests en masse, which they may do to please fans, resulting in a lot of essentially meaningless mutual connections. Instead, outbound one-directional connections come in far smaller numbers, and indicate the content creator is particularly interested in the outputs of the other creators they choose to follow. It is normal for content creators to follow other creators with whom they have collaborated.</p>

    <p>Although their use is to some degree shaped by community norms, such connections are strongly influenced by the architecture of the particular website. However in addition, most of the websites examined allow enough control over the textual content of a profile that profile owners can manually create links to other documents on the web. Creators may also be able to adapt the content publishing interfaces to add additional connections (eg. adding links to Twitter and Facebook accounts in the description of a YouTube video), and often do. These connections necessitate extra effort on the part of the content creator, and tell us more about their relationships with other online accounts. Figure \ref{connections} shows different types of connections between profiles and personas for one content creator.</p>

    <p><img src="fig_fred.eps" alt="Lucas Cruickshank was an early YouTube success story through his persona Fred Figglehorn. Here, different types of connections between various online accounts belonging to both Lucas and Fred are illustrated. \label{connections}" /></p>

    <h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

    <p>Content creators at all levels of activity do not have straightforward relationships with the systems they use for publishing and publicising their content. Through manually examining profiles, it is possible to identify personas, and connections between creators, and understand the likely explanations behind them. Currently there is no way to formalise these deductions. Methods for formalisation are useful for gaining a deeper understanding of the actions in this space, as well as for creating machine-readable representations of social machine participants.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="framework-for-understanding-identities-of-social-machine-participants">

    <h3>Framework for understanding identities of social machine participants</h3>

    <p>Based on the findings previously described, we propose four closely linked but distinct concepts that are useful in a granular discussion of identities of social machine participants: roles, attribution, accountability and traceability.  We explain each in the context of creative media production social machines, and show how they can be used as dimensions to assess the nature of individual identity in a social machine.</p>

    <p><strong>Roles</strong></p>

    <p>A creative media production social machine contains consumers, commentators and curators, and creators \cite{Luther2007a}. These roles are interchangeable, and content creators may wish to adopt different personas according to the role they are playing. Plus, content creators are often multi-talented and they may wish to put on a different face according to the different types of content they publish. How easily this is accomplished, according to the social expectations and technical affordances of a system that is part of a social machine, can impact the behaviour of participants.</p>

    <p><strong>Attribution</strong></p>

    <p>In content creation communities, contributions to media output are directly connected to building reputation, so content creators generally desire to have their name attached to work they produce. If the publication system does not allow this directly, as is often the case for sites that host collaborative works (a video published on one YouTube channel may contain contributions from several creators, each with their own channels), then creators adapt the system as best they can (the uploader may list links to the channels of all contributors in the video description) \cite{Luther2010}. Even when a content host site provides automatic linking to other user profiles – common in remixing communities – this isn't necessarily enough. \cite{Monroy-Hernandez2011} finds that human-given credit means more, and so free-text fields for content metadata are often used anyway.</p>

    <p><strong>Accountability</strong></p>

    <p>In many of the oft-discussed social machines, like Wikipedia, Galaxy Zoo, Ushahidi, and the theoretical crime data social machine in \cite{ByrneEvans2013}, accurate data is critical to the usefulness of the output of the system(s). Thus, accountability through identity is important. It is reasonable then to want to regulate participants somehow. But this cannot be universally applicable.</p>

    <p>The production of creative content is a domain that exemplifies the need for taking a more flexible approach to identity understanding and management. On one hand, creators wish to be accurately credited for their work and plagiarism may even result in a financial or reputational loss. On the other hand, creators may appear under multiple guises, engage in diverse behaviours and make contradictory statements about their participation in a creative work, all in the name of entertainment. Creators may also engage in some activities under an alternative identity in order to avoid any effect on the reputation of their main persona. These are valid uses of the anonymity provided by online spaces – a core feature of the World Wide Web – and should be allowed. Such activities won't necessarily even result in diminished trust. A content consumer may fully enjoy a series of vlogs, unaware that the vlogger is a character and the life events portrayed are entirely fictional, and be none the worse off for it.</p>

    <p><strong>Traceability</strong></p>

    <p>We consider traceability in terms of the settings in which an individual might interact with others. A person participating in a creative media production social machine may exist behind a different persona when participating in a scientific discovery social machine, and yet another in a health and well-being social machine. The discovery that other participants in the health and well-being social machine are aware of their alternate persona in the creative media production social machine may cause them to amend one or both of their personas. If the risk of their multiple identities being 'discovered' is high they may adjust their behaviour accordingly, whether this is ceasing all attempts at 'deception', or taking steps to decrease the overlap of the communities of which they are a part.</p>

    <p>Further to this, well known content creators often appear at offline events to meet their fans. Those who star in popular video content are recognised in the street. They are interviewed by journalists and contracted to produce viral adverts by marketing companies. Only with careful control of their online persona can they successfully engage in offline interactions like this. A content creator who appears in poorly-produced videos as an apparently genuine violent drunk and who sends abusive messages to other website users along the same theme to maintain the persona, may not be considered a candidate for a job in broadcast media. Even if in actuality, they have skilfully written and portrayed a believable character.</p>

    <p>An example in which the traceability of personas was crucial is the DARPA Network Challenge \cite{Tang2011}, for which participants needed to provide their 'real life' identities to win the cash prizes. Even if they had operated under pseudonyms during the competition, in order to validate their claims they needed to make known these personas and consolidate them with an identity that would allow them to receive the prize money.</p>

    <p>Knowledge of others present the online and offline spaces in which someone spends time may influence how they establish their personas in these spaces. An evolution of these spaces or a change in the individual's circumstances over time may cause them to revise their personas.</p>

    <h4 id="applying-the-framework">Applying the framework</h4>

    <p>We can apply these concepts to social machines in order to understand the importance of individuals' identities within them. We use some well known social machines as examples for each dimension.</p>

    <p>The <em>roles</em> dimension describes the ease at which participants can change the role they play in a system.</p>
    <pre>
           one role                      multiple roles                    multiple roles
        everyone equal               participants choose one       participants move between them

               |                                |                                |
           reCAPTCHA                   the Obama campaign            creative media production
    </pre>
<!--      From a system with only one role for all participants, where everyone is equal (like reCAPTCHA), to a system where multiple roles are available but participants are restricted to playing only one (the Obama campaign), to a system where there are multiple roles which participants can move fluidly between (creative media production).</p> -->

    <p>The <em>attribution</em> dimension allows us to consider whether or not crediting participant contributions is important.</p> 
    <pre>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p>We have demonstrated through an empirical study that participants in social machines often have complex relationships with their own self-representation, and with their connections to others in a system. Individuals may have one-to-many or many-to-one relationships with online personas, for a number of different reasons, and with different levels of transparency. We have presented a preliminary framework which allows the degree to which this complexity can affect the overall understanding of a social machine to be assessed along four dimensions: roles, attribution, accountability and traceability.</p>

    <p>All four of these dimensions can be understood to relate to the amount of <em>control</em> a user has over their identity within a system. The role(s) taken on by an individual can be affected by the extent to which an one is able to create and discard identities. Whether participants can be attributed or held accountable for their contributions, and the extent to which one identity can be traced to another, are affected by whether identities are persistent, and whether anonymous contributions are accepted. </p>

    <p>Roles arise through, and may be enforced by, either the technical affordances of a system, or the social expectations of a community (or both). The role(s) an individual chooses to take on may also be affected by their personal motivations, desires or needs. Thus roles are also influenced by the <em>context</em> in which a system is being used.</p>

    <p>Attribution and traceability both relate to the <em>connectivity</em> of a system. Participants may see each others' contributions, and may build reputation accordingly and present a particular impression to their audience. This reputation and impression can translate to other technically disconnected systems if identities are transparently linked.</p>

    <p>Traceability of identities, whether intended or not, can <em>cascade</em> across the Web and feed into a broader network of data about an individual, which may have unforeseen consequences in the future.</p>

  <h2>Social Media Makers</h2>

  <p>The Web today is a very different place than the one imagined by its creator, Tim Berners-Lee~\cite{weavingtheweb}.  Instead of a vast network of individuals running their own web servers to host homepages or share information, most people simply navigate to Twitter to tweet, log in to Facebook to post a status update, use Wordpress.com to write up their thoughts. With a daily active user poulation of over 1.13 billion\footnote{https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2016/Facebook-Reports-Second-Quarter-2016-Results/default.aspx}, Facebook alone constitutes a full quarter of all Web traffic\footnote{http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/04/facebook-is-eating-the-internet/391766/}. </p>

  <p>However, there are individuals who in certain ways reject the massive social platforms that have swallowed the Web. Instead, they embrace 'home-grown' approaches to building their own web presences, much like the 'old days of the Web. But unlike the old days, when such a presence might have comprised a homepage, such 'DIY Web' hackers now piece together their own bespoke social and data management platforms, akin to the kinds of services offered by social platforms, for managing their interactions and identities online. Often, such capabilities are realised by using an ensemble of open source tools supported by developers with like interests. However, the various motivations for these individuals, and the perspectives they have gained from doing so have, thus far, not been studied extensively.</p>

  <p>In the previous section we examined how individuals who participate in massive, centralised online communities present themselves and manage their interactions with an audience. In this section, we present a study which seeks to understand what drives individuals who <em>avoid</em> mainstream social platforms to find other ways to present themselves online, as well as a descriptive characterisation of their digital spaces. We targeted a broad class of self-described <em>digital makers</em>: those who identify with taking a hands-on 'DIY' approach to meet their own immediate online social interaction and self-presentation needs. We conducted semi-structured interviews supported by live demonstrations of participants' own systems and their social media profiles, to address the following questions:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>What are the main motivations of digital makers in replacing or supplementing mainstream social media use with their own personal  systems?</li>
    <li>How do their uses of (if any) and feelings about mainstream social media compare and contrast with their own personal sites?</li>
    <li>What challenges do digital makers face regarding competing discourses from different social contexts, and how do they address these?</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>What is a profile?</h2>

  <p>In order to build on our understanding of the role an online profile plays in self-presentation, identity and interaction we need a more nuanced understanding of what a ‘profile’ <em>is</em> in a general sense. What is the <em>meaning</em> of a profile? We undertake an empirical analysis of digital representations of users on 20 different online systems. From these we derive a set of constructs to capture the most important features of profiles in online systems and evaluate this framework by classifying a further 10 systems according to it (or something). We propose this as groundwork for deriving requirements for profiles when designing new systems which need digital representations of their users, as well as for assessing the benefits and drawbacks of how profiles are implemented in existing systems in such a way that takes into account the contexts in which they are used.</p>
  <p class="notes">Maybe use stuff in participation and interaction of social machines taxonomy http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/362359/1/SOCIAM%20Classificationv2.pdf Could see this as a further breakdown of one of the U categories (see also their methodology pg 13) “Given the value of taxonomies in advancing our understanding of the conceptual landscape associated with a domain”. Taxonomy is very sort of task/activity centric rather than about individuals.</p>

    <h3>Method</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Study: Start with questions to answer about profiles on different sites; refine questions with progress; find overlaps, similarities, differences; turn this into a framework for categorisation/comparison of types of profile. Probably an actual named method for this.</li>
      <li>Justify selection of starting 20 sites:

          <li>Some dimensions to try to cover, like purpose, user base, business model, ..</li>
          <li>types of social media from a classification, eg. Kaplan &amp; Haenlein 2010, White 2014</li>
