# Reading notes (to condense)

## digitalvertigo

## AJ Keen 2012

Solitude is important and impossible.

Expectation of self surveillence is harmful and devisive. He asks, for those who prefer solitude, will they cease to exist?

"Publicness grants immortality" - Public Parts, Jarvis 2011

Facebook makes CIA redundant, cites The Onion.. => what exactly does CIA care about? not your breakfast.

Employers and colleges checking social media (33)

Lots of references to social/search services that are dead now ^^

1984 ownlife

Reid Hoffman - 'transparency rewarded integrity' = Trust economy

Jarvis - publicness will result in more tolerant society (52)

Keen - not. 'open architecture often encourages thos ecompletely lacking in integrity to wreck the reputations of innocent people'

Dalton Conley - intraviduals. Caught between completing identities (<=== BS)

Reputation, competition, actually isolates us as we compete for others' attention. "cloud of glory" - Tresch (119)

Reinvention

Panopticon prisoners - reduced from human beings with their own lives into packaged timelines of processed information (146)

hyperreality - the completely real becomes completely fake.

Imagine a hotel that's a prison - a place that incarcerates us without knowing it (149)

...Turning us into... (179)

forget who we are, what it is to be human (192)


## In Real Life

### Nev Schulman 2014

People creating fake identities to escape. Idealised versions of themselves so people will treat them differently. (Or, to exploit others).

Says this results in people hiding from, rather than dealing with, actual problems. Like portraying yourself how you like online is a bad thing. Usually negative repercussions for you and the people you mislead. Reasons: appearance, sexuality, control, fear, addiction, fantasy.

"fantasy gets in the way of real progress" (42)

==> thinking about 'deception' profiles from the 'hopefuls' perspective.

"we feel safer behind the screen" (89) Less social since no physical.

"we all lie online to varying degrees" (95) => Surveys

"online culture of dishonesty"

"the way you are perceived seems so much more important than what you actually are" (97)

"It should go without saying that we should strive to be honest and honerable in everything we do and say, online and off." (106)

Employers and colleagues googling you and examples (116)

"in the future, everyone will want their 15 minutes of anonymity" (122)

127 - 'rules' for online dating profile, all about honesty but not too revealing.

## Infinite Reality

### Blascovich & Bailenson 2011

"dozens of psychological experiments have shown that..." peoples' avatars affect their IRL, ie. confidence, exercise. (4)

==> this opposes Nev In Real Life

Avatars: "completely anonymous but inherantly traceable"

What is reality?

Convincingness of VR

actual, implied and imagined presence of others - Gordon Allport

Important in VR is belief a person holds about a representation.

Theory-of-mind

Virtual contexts bring different norms and expectations (81)

People behaving differently based on uniforms/colour clothes. Self-perception -> unconscious behaviour (102)

Comparison of avatars with clothes.

Turkle 1995 - playing with unexplored aspects of self (103) turkle quote

How avatar changes behaviour

Nick Yee thesis: EverQuest + WoW self-presentation (104) -> effects of virtual on IRL found (107) "their virtual presence carried over to the physical realm and they did not feel the need to exaggerate"

"role playing... has consequences... for behaviours carried over into the physical world" (114) Age, obesity, race

"the notion of self is fluid in virtual reality" (120)

Scenario where virtual avatar programatically behaves differently to different people (124) Experiment with students engagement with teacher in classroom improved when student thought teacher was making eye contact with only them (but was with all) (128) And scenarios with other students attentive or distracted.

Secondary avatars, semi-controlled to do tasks in games (153)

How do we know who is behind/controlling an avatar (/profile). Agents. 'Hidden cameras' of virtual reality (155)

==> Dmitri Williams - social science methods to study virtual worlds. (160)

==> Sandy Pentland reality mining

Digital footprints to detect liars, psychosis, leadership... @no way to hide the fact that one is a dog" (168)

"even the roles we play are up for grabs in virtual reality. Avatars can reveal sides of people they themselves never knew existed." (260)
