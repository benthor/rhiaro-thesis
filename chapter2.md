# The Presentation of Self Online

The main goal of this chapter is to cover previous work and empirical evidence of how people present themselves, as a basis for better supporting them.

## Performing the self

The obvious place to start when embarking on a discussion about self-presentation is Goffman. In *The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life*, Goffman posits several, now well-established, theories:

* Everyone is performing. The front-stage of our performance is what we create for others - the audience - to see, so that they may evaluate and interact appropriately with us.
* We also have a back-stage; how we act when there is no audience, or an audience of our *team*. Our team participate alongside and collude with on the front-stage.
* Our performances have both conscious and unconscious aspects. That is, we consciously *give* information about ourselves to others in order to manage their impression of us, but we also unconsciously *give off* information that others may pick up on and take into account when deciding how to interact with us.
* Both actors and audiences are complicit in maintaining the cohesion of a situation. Peformances break down if actors break character, deliberately or accidentally, or if there is a mismatch between parties' definition of the situation.

These theories of course apply to face-to-face interaction.

In Faceted Id/entity [@boyd-facid], boyd highlights several differences between self-representation offline compared to online. Embodiment is a key factor in self-presentation and she claims considerable difference between performing one's identity through appearance - eg. fashion and body language - when walking into a room, and explicitly describing oneself by entering attributes and other personal information into an online form to create a profile. 

Self-presentation is largely unconscious in the physical realm and comes naturally the most people. People may also use in-crowd markers (like a shirt with a band logo on) consciously to send certain messages to peole who will recognise them, whilst not drawing any attention from people who won't. The disembodied nature of online interactions means that people must find new ways to express themselves, and manage the impressions other people have of them. A lack of control over one's online self presentation is compounded by the inability to visualise - or perhaps even be aware of - the data that is collected by the systems we use. Online activities are logged over time to an extent that most individuals are not aware of; these activities can be considered as an individual's impressions "given off", and they are used, largely unknowingly, for the commercial benefits of third parties. boyd suggests that visualising all of one's personal information that is available online, as well as visualising one's 'audience' or social network connections, would provide an individual with better awareness of, and so better control over, their online image. In body's prototype interfaces, users are explicitly asked for personal data in order to build a profile of themselves, and boyd does point out the problematic nature of this, compared with the unconscious or implicit identity performance one conducts in offline social settings.

Since these prototypes were designed, social media gained widespread popularity. Most, if not all, mainstream systems request input of expicit personal data to build an initial profile, despite the discord of this activity compared with offline. However, unlike in boyd's prototypes, it doesn't stop there. Such systems encourage ongoing engagement through adding and messaging contacts with various degress of publicness, creating status updates to broadcast a current situation, production of creative media content, and feedback on content and updates created by others. As we will see in chapter 3, contemporary social media build one's profile from various combinations of these online activities, and typically use far more than the explicit data entered by the user to generate a representation of a person. Nonetheless, users may not have an accurate impression of what this representation looks like to others.

Transparency of data collected, and control over how it is distributed is key to boyd's thesis of how to empower individuals online. Sadly, the situation here has not improved in the intervening eight years. Indeed, private corporations are collecting more and more personal data through free social networking sites, and granting the subjects zero rights with regard to access or distribution. Various big data scandals [@cites] that gained media attention, plus Snowden etc, mean that awareness of surveillence and personal data collection is growing amongst the general public. Later in this chapter we elaborate on how privacy concerns impact online disclosure and profile creation behaviours; we then build on the copious existing literature with an empirical study of a community of hackers intent on decentralised data storage as a means to greater control.

### The self in context

Development of personal identity is not only something that happens internally. We are strongly influenced by feedback (conscious and unconscious) from others around us, as well as the particular setting and culture in which we find ourselves. Thus identity is *socially* constructed, and often is adjusted according to *context* [@cites socsci via boyd-facid]. 

(self-awareness is identity situated as in society.) A person's understanding of the context in which they are performing impacts their perfomance [@boyd-facid]. boyd argues that online, people find it much more difficult to evaluate this context, and thus run increasead risk of performing inappropriately, or experience *context collapse* when multiple audiences are inadvertantly combined. (TODO: expand context collapse. MS Passport as boyd's example. G+/YT as mine. Some Guardian etc articles)

Beyond simply visualising all of one's personal information, and the connections between social network contacts to show how personal data may flow through a network, boyd suggests that these visualisations can be used to actively segregate one's contacts along parameters which correspond to one's personal information, permitting an individual to perform identity more appropriately in digital spaces. However in practice, designing user interfaces for this proves to be challenging. For one, people aren't used to explicitly thinking about audience and context, so dividing their contacts up this way is not natural. 

.... political, cultural, racial. stuff about web dissolving these [@Turkle], but not really. [@Kenny] study about people using identity language (with a corpus of terms that corresponds to culture/society), but in content not wrt themselves or in their profiles.

An audience that is not considered by boyd (actually double check, maybe this is mentioned in Mirror), and probably others when I summarise more relevant studies here, is the wider network of data consumers beyond one's social network connections. Data derived from explicit input and implicit activities, and aggregates of thousands of 'people like you'. That is, the commercial entities, machine learning algorithms, digital marketers, advertising agencies, and our various evil corporate overlords. The tension of sharing personal data with these third parties vs. wanting to reach an audience of known human connections, is typically discussed with regards to weighing up privacy concerns; discussed later in this chapter.

### The project of the self

* Giddens, Modernity (identity as separateness/uniqueness; personal construction as opposed to ascription due to the loss of traditional anchors. Construction of "self" as an "ongoing project")

Arguably even more of a 'project' in explicit digital spaces. Persistence and searchability as architectural differences between physical and digital [@boyd-facid] play in here.

### Authenticity

## Offline to online... and back again

When people use digital technologies to communicate, they are passing a version of themselves through the filter of the platform they use. Aspects of their offline identity may be mediated by a particular technology as they input into a system, and similarly as their input is consumed by the reciever, who may even be using a different technology. 

..Similarities and differences between Goffman's frontstage and back stage...

Online identities are not only a reflection of offline identities, but the inverse can be true as well. Feedback loop.

## Growing up online

Social self-presentation literature applied to the online space is mostly applied to these aliens called 'young people'. This is probably because online features heavily in a particularly formative part of life when identity construction is happening hardcore.

## Bloggers

..speaking of networked publics...

* Lots of work on identity and bloggers, especially wrt journalism/media.
* Russell, A. (2009) International Blogging. -> various studies from a non-Western perspective <-

Identity is both individually and socially constructed. Identity expression through personal blogs is very individualistic; bloggers have traditionally had quite a bit of control over not only what they choose to share and write about, but how it is presented, organised and laid out. ..[@thatbloggingstudy] describes importance of themes and designs, and mentions that some people use a feed reader to subscribe but click through to the original post to read in context...

Whilst bloggers (during peak blogging years like 2007) do collaboratively construct their identities through interactions with the community, they were mostly restricted to commenting on other people's posts. This fragments their contributions across different domains, and where their writing style and topics constitute a part of their identity, so it fragments their identity.

Present day social media has dramatically increased participation in publishing and sharing online content [@citationeeded]. Easy-to-use services lower the barrier to entry for connecting with and pushing thoughts out to an audience. Identities expressed through social media are inherantly collaborative; every interaction is pushed to a network, and part of a dynamic cycle of consumption and creation feedback. Commenting on someone else's post automatically links it to your own profile, and often it appears there as well, accessible from two different contexts. Yet they permit little customisation, providing preset options for content or reaction templates, and consistent inflexible designs for profile pages. This tips the balance away from the individual aspect of identity construction, and differentiates current social media practices from a generation of bloggers who populated the web prior to the mainstream adoption of social media.

## To share or not to share (privacy and social media)

Tensions between convenience of sharing on social media and increasing awareness of privacy concerns.

Does self-censorship stifle personal expression? How does this impact identity construction?

  * "Researchers have found that users have many friends and desire to selectively share with multiple audiences [Boyd and Ellison 2007]. However, users struggle to manage their privacy settings as they are quite complex and change frequently. As a result, users can share information more broadly than intended, even among people they have friended [Johnson et al. 2012], resulting in embarrassment or regret [Wang et al. 2011]. Rather than adjust confusing privacy settings, users may resort to various coping mechanisms such as censoring their disclosures [Wisniewski et al. 2012]."

## Technoself

Dive into this... 'field' since 2013.. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technoself

## The ghost in the (social) machine

Social Machines are systems for which the human and computational aspects are equally critical. In most cases, humans do the creative work whilst machines do the administrative tasks [@Timbl1999]. Up to now, systems have not been designed *to be* Social Machines; rather, the concept and definition of a Social Machine is derived from observations of existing (usually Web-based) systems. Many are products of the contemporary social web, on many different scales and in many different domains, often evolving, responding to technological and social developments, and interacting with each other [@Hendler2010, @ByrneEvans2013, @DeRoure2013, @Strohmaier2013]. Social Machines can be identified within and across social media networks, within and across online communities, and within and across technological spaces.

Social Machines are pertinent to our work here as they provide a lens through which we can examine sociotechnical phenomena which emphasises the interdependence between humans and technology. In studies of social networks discussed previously in this chapter, humans are considered as *users* of systems, and discussions focus around how people react to technology, how people behave in the context of particular technical or social constraints, or how people's lives are changed in response to their interactions with and through digital environments. It is important to also reflect upon the ways in which technology evolves or is reconceptualised as a result of passive (mis)use and active (mis)appropriation by humans. We similarly must recognise technical systems in the wider context of society, and include in our dialogue the developers who design and build technical systems, the organisations and legal entities which finance and drive them, and the cultural and economic climate in which they are situated.

Social Machines which have been studied so far have been described and categorised in terms of purpose [@DeRoure2013], motivations and incentives, technology used, goals and processes, quality assessment of outputs, and user participation and interaction [@Smart2014]. The emphasis in this work is on discussing Social Machines in collective terms; that is, 'a' Social Machine - wherever its boundaries happen to have been drawn (so far these boundaries are typically drawn around the edge of a "service" [@Smart2014]) - is considered as a coherent whole. The circumstances of the individual human participants not been given extensive consideration *(TODO: barring ... update from 2014+ lit)*. For any given Social Machine, individual participants are diverse and participate in different ways, with varying goals, motivations and outcomes. As we have seen with through studies of social media mentioned previously, they manipulate their online presence(s) so that they may behave in different ways according to different contexts, or may work together to construct a single image controlled by multiple people [@Dalton2013]. Such behaviour impacts our understanding of roles, autonomy and awareness, incentives and attribution, and accountability and trustworthiness of participants. Overlooking unique individual perspectives when observing a Social Machine as a whole can cause incorrect assumptions, for example: believing that participants who lie about who they are have negative intentions in a Social Machine whose overall "purpose" is to strengthen social ties. We must also bear this in mind when designing systems, so that a system may grow in response to unexpected actions of participants rather than hampering their explorations.

We argue that due to the complex nature of online identity, understanding nuanced individual behaviours of participants in a more granular way is crucial for Social Machine observation. We advance this argument in {part x} through an empirical study of a Social Machine centered around creative media production.

## Constructing online identity

Hinted on by [@boyd-facid, cite, cite, cite], individuals are rapidly and often intuitively developing coping mechanisms and practices to more effectively manage their online self-presentation and impression management despite the constraints of the tools they use. This section explores some of these behaviours through three empirical studies:

* of the personal branding of creative content producers on YouTube;
* of social media 'makers' who control their social interactions through personal websites;
* of deception and lying for impression management in mainstream social media.

### Creative Media Production Social Machines

Work in this section was previously published as *Constructed Identity and Social Machines: A Case Study in Creative Media Production* (2014, Proceedings of WWW, Seoul). 

In {part x} we described existing work in understanding socio-technical systems as Social Machines, and argue that due to the complex nature of online identity, understanding nuanced identity behaviours of Social Machine participants in a more granular way is crucial. Here, we briefly describe _creative media production social machines_, and present the results of a study of personas portrayed by participants in one of these. We then describe additional dimensions along which a Social Machine can be classified in order to better understand human participants as individuals.

Amongst the plethora of user-generated content on the web are a huge number of works of creative media, and behind these are independent content creators pushing their work to a global audience and actively seeking to further their reach. Within this ecosystem we can see _creative media production social machines_ on a variety of different scales. The definition of creative media production social machines encompasses a broad class of systems where:

* humans may use a purely digital, or combination of digital and analogue methods, and a degree of creative effort, to produce media content;
* the content is published such that it is publicly accessible on the web;
* a global audience may consume, curate and commentate on this content in technologically-mediated environments.

These social machines exist both within and across content host platforms (eg. YouTube) and within and across online communities and social networks. Many, if not all, media types and genres are represented among the media artefacts that emerge from these systems, and the content combines with its reception to have a sometimes profound effect on media and culture in the offline world.

Figure \ref{vlog} shows the interconnected social and technical systems engaged when a simple vlog (video blog) is uploaded to YouTube. These processes would be further expanded if the creator was to branch out and produce different types of content, collaborate with another creator, cross-publicise, share audiences or even co-own a YouTube channel or other website profile.

![Interconnected social and technical systems necessary for publishing a vlog on YouTube.\label{vlog}](figs/fig_vlog.eps)

Creative media production social machines create an environment in which content creators of all backgrounds and abilities are able to publish outside of the constraints of traditional media channels. These creators are actively vying for attention from the masses; competing for views, likes and shares on a global scale. How they present themselves to their audience can be critical to their success, but also a ground for playful experimentation.

**Motivations for participation**

It is worth noting that there are a variety of motivations or incentives for content creators to participate in these systems.

Some content host sites provide direct financial incentive for popularity (eg. YouTube's Google Adsense). Others facilitate a commission based model, where creators show off their work and take paid requests for custom pieces from the community (eg. DeviantArt). For content creators who publish primarily on such systems, their activity on other systems is usually tied to driving traffic back to the content which makes them money, or entertaining the fanbase from whom they thrive (eg. a creator who publishes sketch comedy on YouTube might use their Twitter account to tell original jokes to maintain interest in between video releases).

But for many content creators, the financial rewards from their chosen content host sites might be a convenient side-effect of doing something that they love. Reputation as a creator of high quality content, a talented artist or a particularly funny comedian might be their primary driver. There are also social cues in many communities that affect content creator behaviour. Sometimes creators don't want to be accused of 'pandering' to their audience or losing their artistic integrity, and regulate their behaviour accordingly.

The visibility of quantitative data collected by a content host site -- such as how many views a piece of content has, how often they are referred to as a co-creator, or how often a content creator persona responds to viewer comments -- may also impact behaviour. Technical factors are often highly conflated with the social norms in a community.

Thus, the core reasons for creating content can affect both the content created and how creators present themselves to their audience in the process.

#### Constructed online identity

The nature of identity and anonymity in online spaces is well discussed \cite{Donath2002, Halpin2006, Rains2007, Ren2012}. Humans naturally adjust the way they present themselves according to the context, and different online spaces may afford different levels of flexibility in doing this. Some systems don't require any kind of registration to post content, allowing people to adopt and discard personas as needed, and to create social cues to identify each other that are not designed as part of the system \cite{Bernstein2011}. Entirely different behaviour occurs in systems that strongly encourage or even try to enforce usage of real names. Often it is trivial for people to create multiple accounts under different pseudonyms anyway, but there may be an increased expectation of honesty from other users of the system, which itself affects the culture of communities within. 

In many cases the fact that people present themselves differently in different contexts is unconscious; a side effect of their participation in a particular system according to the social norms or technical affordances (eg.\ their desired username may be unavailable resulting in the forging of new branding around an alternative). In other cases, the creation of alternative personas is engineered and deliberate, either from the outset or as something that has evolved over time. But, beyond carefully crafting a single identity each, multiple individuals may participate in the portrayal of a single persona \cite{Dalton2013} and one individual may present versions of themselves through _multiple_ personas.

#### Study of creator profiles

The public profiles of content creators were examined to discover a) how they present themselves, b) how they spread their online presence across different websites, platforms or communities, and how they spread their content across their different presences c) how they present connections between representations of themselves, and d) how they present connections with other content creators. We also take note of their audience, the type of content they create, and the capabilities of the platforms on which they publish their content, to add context. 

The results presented here are preliminary, and obviously based upon a very small (albeit diverse) sample, and cannot be considered conclusive. We later discuss future work in improving and extending this study, as well as describe an experiment to study the roles of content creators in large communities in more detail.

##### Content creators

Ten content creators were selected from a subset of creators with whose content we have a passing familiarity through encountering it online over the past months to years. This resulted in a broad spectrum of content types (video, animation, music, art, written word) genres (comedy, game commentaries, educational, political), popularity, well-knownness and activity levels. We deliberately examined content creator profiles from the perspective of a content consumer, or casual audience member. Thus, for the purposes of this study, we do not have access to deeper insight about the personas beyond what is accessible publicly through the web. Future work that expands on this is discussed later.

##### Profiles and personas

For ten content creators, 93 profiles were discovered. Of these, 23 were YouTube channels, 16 Twitter profiles, 13 Facebook, 9 Vimeo, 7 Tumblr, 6 personal websites, 5 Instagram and 4 Vine, 3 Google Plus, 2 Bandcamp and 2 DeviantArt and 1 each of Patreon, FormSpring, BlipTV, and Newgrounds. Table \ref{creators} shows how the profiles are distributed. As we can see, in the domain of creative content production identities are not site- or community-specific. Creators spread their activities across a number of networks in order to shape a more complete identity. 

| Creator | # profiles | Mean profiles per site |
| ======= | ========== | ====================== |
| Dane    | 18         |          2.3           |

**Table: Distribution of profiles for content creators in the study.**

'Second channels' are common on YouTube. Creators who focus on one type of content (eg.\ sketch comedy) publish this on their main channel as well as using their main channel identity for interactions on the site. On their second channel they publish content that they may consider to be of interest to only a part of their main audience, such as vlogs about their lives, outtakes from main channel content, or experimental pieces. Most content creators with second channels post explicit links to them on their main channel, and often publicise them within content metadata or as part of the content directly. In some cases, including those where the connection between two channels is explicit and obvious, the creators behave differently towards their audience through second channel content. This varies greatly depending on the type of content produced. In some cases, second channels may be perceived as more reflective of the creator's 'true' personality, if they project themselves as more serious or honest, and publish more personal content like vlogs or behind-the-scenes footage. Whether or not this is accurate is impossible to know without intimate knowledge of the creators' offline life of course. The significance is that persona variations exist, and creators do not necessarily hide these alternative presentations of themselves from their audience.

Additionally, there are profiles which are _not_ directly linked from the (self-identified) 'main' profile, or the links are treated as though to the profile of a different person. Figure \ref{clinks} shows three screenshots of different YouTube channels showing different ways creators link out to other versions of themselves.

![Dane transparently links to 3 of his channels, two for alternative content types and one for a character he created.  2. Fred is a character played by Lucas, but the links on Fred's channel treat Lucas as a different person. 3. Andrew Lemming lists Khyan as "Uncle", although Khyan is the creator of the Andrew Lemming character. \label{clinks}](fig_channellinks.eps)

Creators also used their profiles to link to shared channels (where either multiple creators post content independently of each other, or creators collaborate to produce joint content, or a both), and channels of others with whom they regularly work.

Most profile host sites offer limited options for customisation, and the use of consistent branding was intermittent. This mostly took the form of identical or similarly styled display pictures, similarly phrased introductory paragraphs, and similarly styled content.

Some creators have profiles which are distinctly grouped into alternative personas. This was evident from the branding, content and connections between them.

##### Connections

How connections to other people were represented varied depending on the technical system. We can differentiate between mutual relationships between accounts (eg. 'friend') and one-directional relationships (eg. 'follower', 'subscriber'). Some systems offer both types of relationship, some one or the other. For YouTube channels, popularity ranged from over 3.5 million subscribers for Dane's character channel _realannoyingorange_ to 118 for Bown's secondary _bowntalks_ channel.

The importance of these connections varies depending on the system as well as on the attitude of the system user. Mutual connections may initially be presumed to indicate a closer relationship, but this is not always the case. Some systems allow users to accept all friend requests en masse, which they may do to please fans, resulting in a lot of essentially meaningless mutual connections. Instead, outbound one-directional connections come in far smaller numbers, and indicate the content creator is particularly interested in the outputs of the other creators they choose to follow. It is normal for content creators to follow other creators with whom they have collaborated.

Although their use is to some degree shaped by community norms, such connections are strongly influenced by the architecture of the particular website. However in addition, most of the websites examined allow enough control over the textual content of a profile that profile owners can manually create links to other documents on the web. Creators may also be able to adapt the content publishing interfaces to add additional connections (eg. adding links to Twitter and Facebook accounts in the description of a YouTube video), and often do. These connections necessitate extra effort on the part of the content creator, and tell us more about their relationships with other online accounts. Figure \ref{connections} shows different types of connections between profiles and personas for one content creator.

![Lucas Cruickshank was an early YouTube success story through his persona Fred Figglehorn. Here, different types of connections between various online accounts belonging to both Lucas and Fred are illustrated. \label{connections}](fig_fred.eps)

##### Summary

Content creators at all levels of activity do not seem to have straightforward relationships with the systems they use for publishing and publicising their content. Through manually examining profiles, it is possible to identify personas, and connections between creators, and understand the likely explanations behind them. Currently there is no way to formalise these deductions. Methods for formalisation are useful for gaining a deeper understanding of the actions in this space, as well as for creating machine-readable representations of social machine participants. 

#### Framework for understanding identities of social machine participants

Based on the findings previously described, we propose four closely linked but distinct concepts that are useful in a granular discussion of identities of social machine participants: roles, attribution, accountability and traceability.  We explain each in the context of creative media production social machines, and show how they can be used as dimensions to assess the nature of individual identity in a social machine.

**Roles**

A creative media production social machine contains consumers, commentators and curators, and creators \cite{Luther2007a}. These roles are interchangeable, and content creators may wish to adopt different personas according to the role they are playing. Plus, content creators are often multi-talented and they may wish to put on a different face according to the different types of content they publish. How easily this is accomplished, according to the social expectations and technical affordances of a system that is part of a social machine, can impact the behaviour of participants.

**Attribution**

In content creation communities, contributions to media output are directly connected to building reputation, so content creators generally desire to have their name attached to work they produce. If the publication system does not allow this directly, as is often the case for sites that host collaborative works (a video published on one YouTube channel may contain contributions from several creators, each with their own channels), then creators adapt the system as best they can (the uploader may list links to the channels of all contributors in the video description) \cite{Luther2010}. Even when a content host site provides automatic linking to other user profiles -- common in remixing communities -- this isn't necessarily enough. \cite{Monroy-Hernandez2011} finds that human-given credit means more, and so free-text fields for content metadata are often used anyway.

**Accountability**

In many of the oft-discussed social machines, like Wikipedia, Galaxy Zoo, Ushahidi, and the theoretical crime data social machine in \cite{ByrneEvans2013}, accurate data is critical to the usefulness of the output of the system(s). Thus, accountability through identity is important. It is reasonable then to want to regulate participants somehow. But this cannot be universally applicable.

The production of creative content is a domain that exemplifies the need for taking a more flexible approach to identity understanding and management. On one hand, creators wish to be accurately credited for their work and plagiarism may even result in a financial or reputational loss. On the other hand, creators may appear under multiple guises, engage in diverse behaviours and make contradictory statements about their participation in a creative work, all in the name of entertainment. Creators may also engage in some activities under an alternative identity in order to avoid any effect on the reputation of their main persona. These are valid uses of the anonymity provided by online spaces -- a core feature of the World Wide Web -- and should be allowed. Such activities won't necessarily even result in diminished trust. A content consumer may fully enjoy a series of vlogs, unaware that the vlogger is a character and the life events portrayed are entirely fictional, and be none the worse off for it.

**Traceability**

We consider traceability in terms of the settings in which an individual might interact with others. A person participating in a creative media production social machine may exist behind a different persona when participating in a scientific discovery social machine, and yet another in a health and well-being social machine. The discovery that other participants in the health and well-being social machine are aware of their alternate persona in the creative media production social machine may cause them to amend one or both of their personas. If the risk of their multiple identities being 'discovered' is high they may adjust their behaviour accordingly, whether this is ceasing all attempts at 'deception', or taking steps to decrease the overlap of the communities of which they are a part.

Further to this, well known content creators often appear at offline events to meet their fans. Those who star in popular video content are recognised in the street. They are interviewed by journalists and contracted to produce viral adverts by marketing companies. Only with careful control of their online persona can they successfully engage in offline interactions like this. A content creator who appears in poorly-produced videos as an apparently genuine violent drunk and who sends abusive messages to other website users along the same theme to maintain the persona, may not be considered a candidate for a job in broadcast media. Even if in actuality, they have skilfully written and portrayed a believable character.

An example in which the traceability of personas was crucial is the DARPA Network Challenge \cite{Tang2011}, for which participants needed to provide their 'real life' identities to win the cash prizes. Even if they had operated under pseudonyms during the competition, in order to validate their claims they needed to make known these personas and consolidate them with an identity that would allow them to receive the prize money.

Knowledge of others present the online and offline spaces in which someone spends time may influence how they establish their personas in these spaces. An evolution of these spaces or a change in the individual's circumstances over time may cause them to revise their personas.

##### Applying the framework

We can apply these concepts to social machines in order to understand the importance of individuals' identities within them. We use some well known social machines as examples for each dimension.

The _roles_ dimension describes the ease at which participants can change the role they play in a system. From a system with only one role for all participants, where everyone is equal (like reCAPTCHA), to a system where multiple roles are available but participants are restricted to playing only one (the Obama campaign), to a system where there are multiple roles which participants can move fluidly between (creative media production).

The _attribution_ dimension allows us to consider whether or not crediting participant contributions is important. This is entirely unimportant for reCAPTCHA, slightly important for Wikipedia, and far more important for creative media production.

The _accountability_ dimension helps us to decide whether the provenance of the inputs make a difference. In a crime reporting social machine this would be critical, so regulating identities to ensure trustworthy data would make sense. It is only important to a certain degree for creative media production, and it is unimportant for GalaxyZoo, for example.

The _traceability_ dimension relates to the transparency of connections between different personas. A reliable connection to an identity as a US citizen was critical for participants of the DARPA Network Challenge, but high traceability of content creator personas may cause problems if they are trying to project a particular image.

#### Conclusion

We have demonstrated through an empirical study that participants in social machines often have complex relationships with their own self-representation, and with their connections to others in a system. Individuals may have one-to-many or many-to-one relationships with online personas, for a number of different reasons, and with different levels of transparency. We have presented a preliminary framework which allows the degree to which this complexity can affect the overall understanding of a social machine to be assessed along four dimensions: roles, attribution, accountability and traceability.

### indieweb

Interviews

Does the indieweb attempt to recapture the more individualistic aspects of identity management, whilst retaining audience and feedback - collaborative identity construction - on the scale enabled by centralised services?

### Pro-social deception

Deception as a tool for social impression management online

  * Lying survey
  * lieCloud case studies

Magic quadrant for this stuff? Unconscious vs conscious effort 

but also people-system, leads to... ----> chapter 3!

## Conclusions

do we run a risk of losing out on the collaborative aspects of identity construction if we designs decentralised systems which aren't sufficiently federated? Must acknowledge the criticality of interaction for identity formation.

Misuse of systems by content creators, 'liars', etc. Replacement of functions of systems by developers. What can we learn from these.

### Limitiations and reflections

My perspective. Western bias.

Reading all these studies from the last five to ten years about teens' changing attention, changing priorities, changing emotional states (or ways of handling it) due to technology, it occurred me to me they're talking about me (or is that narcissistic?). Some things I read are instinctively familiar; obvious. Some are ridiculous. How does my first-hand experience of growing up with technology affect my reading of studies, and my ability to study others?

## digitalvertigo

### AJ Keen 2012

Solitude is important and impossible.

Expectation of self surveillence is harmful and devisive. He asks, for those who prefer solitude, will they cease to exist?

"Publicness grants immortality" - Public Parts, Jarvis 2011

Facebook makes CIA redundant, cites The Onion.. => what exactly does CIA care about? not your breakfast.

Employers and colleges checking social media (33)

Lots of references to social/search services that are dead now ^^

1984 ownlife

Reid Hoffman - 'transparency rewarded integrity' = Trust economy

Jarvis - publicness will result in more tolerant society (52)

Keen - not. 'open architecture often encourages thos ecompletely lacking in integrity to wreck the reputations of innocent people'

Dalton Conley - intraviduals. Caught between completing identities (<=== BS)

Reputation, competition, actually isolates us as we compete for others' attention. "cloud of glory" - Tresch (119)

Reinvention

Panopticon prisoners - reduced from human beings with their own lives into packaged timelines of processed information (146)

hyperreality - the completely real becomes completely fake.

Imagine a hotel that's a prison - a place that incarcerates us without knowing it (149)

...Turning us into... (179)

forget who we are, what it is to be human (192)


## In Real Life

### Nev Schulman 2014

People creating fake identities to escape. Idealised versions of themselves so people will treat them differently. (Or, to exploit others).

Says this results in people hiding from, rather than dealing with, actual problems. Like portraying yourself how you like online is a bad thing. Usually negative repercussions for you and the people you mislead. Reasons: appearance, sexuality, control, fear, addiction, fantasy.

"fantasy gets in the way of real progress" (42)

==> thinking about 'deception' profiles from the 'hopefuls' perspective.

"we feel safer behind the screen" (89) Less social since no physical.

"we all lie online to varying degrees" (95) => Surveys

"online culture of dishonesty"

"the way you are perceived seems so much more important than what you actually are" (97)

"It should go without saying that we should strive to be honest and honerable in everything we do and say, online and off." (106)

Employers and colleagues googling you and examples (116)

"in the future, everyone will want their 15 minutes of anonymity" (122)

127 - 'rules' for online dating profile, all about honesty but not too revealing.

## Infinite Reality

### Blascovich & Bailenson 2011

"dozens of psychological experiments have shown that..." peoples' avatars affect their IRL, ie. confidence, exercise. (4)

==> this opposes Nev In Real Life

Avatars: "completely anonymous but inherantly traceable"

What is reality?

Convincingness of VR

actual, implied and imagined presence of others - Gordon Allport

Important in VR is belief a person holds about a representation.

Theory-of-mind

Virtual contexts bring different norms and expectations (81)

People behaving differently based on uniforms/colour clothes. Self-perception -> unconscious behaviour (102)

Comparison of avatars with clothes.

Turkle 1995 - playing with unexplored aspects of self (103) turkle quote

How avatar changes behaviour

Nick Yee thesis: EverQuest + WoW self-presentation (104) -> effects of virtual on IRL found (107) "their virtual presence carried over to the physical realm and they did not feel the need to exaggerate"

"role playing... has consequences... for behaviours carried over into the physical world" (114) Age, obesity, race

"the notion of self is fluid in virtual reality" (120)

Scenario where virtual avatar programatically behaves differently to different people (124) Experiment with students engagement with teacher in classroom improved when student thought teacher was making eye contact with only them (but was with all) (128) And scenarios with other students attentive or distracted.

Secondary avatars, semi-controlled to do tasks in games (153)

How do we know who is behind/controlling an avatar (/profile). Agents. 'Hidden cameras' of virtual reality (155)

## App Generation

### Gardner & Davis 2013

=> Davis thesis blogs identity youth Bermuda

Three Is - identity, intimacy, imagination - have been reconfigured by apps

Teens crafted online persona ~ true sense of self (feed into each other)

Facebook relationship status option s- "give rise to new forms of imaginative expression... application shapes and restricts these expressions in distinct and distinctive ways" 6

=> "An 'app' or 'application' is... tightly controlled by the individual or organisation that designed teh app." 6

Weird idea that if there isn't an app for something it doesn't matter 8

App-enabling vs app-dependant 10

5 year study 150 young people in New England and fewer in Bermuda. 7 focus groups with 6-10 adults who have worked with young people for >20 years. 40 interviews with high school teachers. Compared student art (writing and graphics) gathered over 20 years - how changed.

Need to consider how earlier technologies like telephone defined youth 13

Proposes that generations may be defined by dominant technologies (=> too fast!)

Componants of technlogy: tools and machines, information, media, human psychology.

McLuhan alert 22 Each medium, extension of human sensory organs, alters relation of individual to the surrounding world.

Devices more personal - control over what is sent and received - compared to radio and TV (=> compare to who controls apps though?)

'The paradox of action and restriction' 24

"Can constitute a challenge - asking us what we can accomplish despite these restrictions" 25

"wrt identity formation: Apps can short-circuit identity formation, pushing you into being someone else's avatar - or, ... they can allow you to approach identity formation more deliberately, holistically, thoughtfully." 32

"prepackaged identity", "endless role diffusion"

Pro tech - danah, Cathy Davidson, Henry Jenkins, Shirky, David Weinberger.

Anti tech - Nicholas Carr, Mark Bauerlein, Cass Sunstein, Sherry T, Janen Lamien(?)

"we believe more and more young people are app-dependant than app-enabled" 45

Young people expressing consistency between online and offline selves 63

But online is often a 'polished' version. Not one-to-one. Youth interviwed said online identity is 'less complete' than offline 64

Sometimes due to constraints of platform. More common - privacy.

"Do apps open up or constrain identity expresson?" 66

"The standard elements of a profile on facebook... are used to package the self for public consumption" 71 "Presentation and performance are also central on YouTube"

Narcissism - constant need for support/validation/self-assurance, enabled by web. But young people less secure and more risk-averse, hopeless.

Identities with religious communities lessened; young people identify with multiple groups "sympathies are distributed" More accepting of diversity. 87

Access to wider range of online communities means niche identities don't have to be set aside to fit in 90 - enabling

"apps to augment or replace offline relationships?" 110

Responsibility on parents and app developers to steer towards enabling over dependant.

## Born Digital

### Palfrey and Gasser 2008

Obviously dated. Addressed to old people who are scared of da youts.

Explains how 'digital natives' are so vastly different then goes on to say how they're not different at all. That's okay I suppose.

Online enables fluid experimentation with identity but also keeps a record so identities are traceable.

"Digital natives almost never distinguish between the online and offline versions of themselves", "multiple representations inform her overall identity"

=> Identity management = multiple presentations of self on facebook DiMiccio and Miller - says should build tools to support bridging communities.

=> Youth, Identity and Digital Media

=> Huffaker and Calvert, Gender Identity and Language Use in Teenage Blogs

=> Calvert - Identity Construction on the Internet

"changes are far greater for social than for personal identity"

Reward vs risk of self-disclosure. Young people understimate risks. 25

"The structural design of online platforms both constrains and builds upon these means of building networks of identity and trust"

=> Still quite a lot of focus on the visuals of avatars, 'controlled' by user, like wearing a mask. I suppose that's the most obvious way of telling ifn someone is trying a new 'identity' if they design an image for themselves that physically different. 'Virtual worlds'

34 "can adjust her digital identity with ease, but has far less ability to control how her identity is percievied by others", "she appears to have much more control over her identity but in fact she has much less"

"more bound to a single identity"

"identities might converge... even more than identities ever converged before the digital era."

"...created multiple identities... might be connected to create a much fuller picture of the individual... spanning a greater period of time."

36 "Most digital natives have an instinct about... identity expression an dformation in a digital age"

## International Blogging

### 2009 Adrienne Russell, Nabil Echchaibi

Focus on non-US. Counter to work that says spread of blogging as spread of Western democratic ideals. "power dynamics offline influence developments online".

Audience reception theory (Ang 1985)

US media practice remade around the world to better suit needs (Appadira 1996). Media technologies as often oppressive as liberating. Blogging celebrated as extended public journalism.

Theme in this book: blogs to "negotiate and articulate identity"

"many uses of blogs... talking about blogging as a uniform act with well-defined goals can be misleading" (Bruns and Jacobs 2006). Arguement for individual case studies instead of generalisations.

Difference between A list blogs and smaller ones. We need to study latter, but rarely do so. "not only incarnate better the potential of Internet users to challenge elite control of news production, but they also show us on a smaller scale how individuals and communities use netowrk technologies to sustain new forms of social, cultural and economic solidarity" (12)

Circa 2007 people saw blogging as revolutionary and empowering for individuals, decentralising. "we live in a new era of complex and non-linear communication" (15)

#### Paris banlieues

Individual and community identities defined by mainstream media - blogs allow people to redefine their identities for themselves (23). Had a knock-on effect on traditional media re: Paris banleiues

#### Muslim

"Blogging as a cultural practice" (29)

"the inherant and irreducible dynamism of any identity"

Reading 25 blogs over 9 months in 2007, specifically Muslim authors, themes linked to Islam, all English.

"How is publicness reconfigured in Muslim blogs?", "concurrent existence of both intellectual, reasoned analysis and arguements with emotional expressions and responses"

Structural societal biases strip Muslims of rationality, but blogging empowers them to express in-depth analyses alongside reasoned and justified emotional responses.

Posting comments on blogs enables publicness, as publicness entails dialogue (39)

"almost seamless merging of political/public themes with the more personal/private ones". Typically private issues (by Euro standard) become issues for public discussion. "the lines between private and public are constantly shifting, and perhaps blogs might be ghtough of as contributing to such shifts" (40)

Blogging opens for dialgue but not guarentee it (commentors are dumb) - cannot expenct consensus. More to kick start debate. 

=> Giddens - modernity and self-identity. Identity as separateness and uniqueness. Also personal construction rather than ascription now due to loss of traditional anchors. "having a self means being in charge of an ongoing project" (24)

"Muslim identities are considered to be more or less uniform and Muslim people appear interchangeable with each other rather than unique individuals... However blogging acts in ways that effectively establish the separateness and uniqueness of each blogger, first by naming and authoring a blog and secondly by having a unique URL address" (42)

'I' and 'me' as claiming the blog as part of the blogger's identity => (Amir-Ebrahimi 2004, Reed 2005)

"blogging combines identity-in-the-making with connection with others, who also help define this identity. Thus for a blogger to choose and list their friends and their enemies, to write about who and what they like or not, show that they mutually define each other" ... "the fact that the blogger has discretion over most parts of the blog, shows that indeed to some extent they define and construct their own identity, while on the other the mobilization of other blogs or blog entries in doing so, denotes the collaborative or social elements of this construction".

"Muslim blogging reconfigures identity as both shared-ness and unique-ness" (does it?)

"ways in which blogging practices can reenter or feed back into both the formal, institutional aspects of life, and into the everyday politics of coexistence"

* Amir-Ebrahimi, 2004, Performance in everyday life and the rediscovery of the 'self' in Iranian weblogs
* Alexanian, J. 2006 Publicly initimate online: Iranian weblogs in Souther CA
* Burns and Jacobs 2006 Use of blogs
* Giddens 1991 Modernity and self-identity
* Reed 2005 "My blog is me"

Blogs analysed 25, 11 blogspots, 4 wordpress.com, 1 blogsome, 9 domains (1 sub .pickledpolitics.com)

#### China

"bloggers defining themselves for an international audience"

"If they become popular, these writers may be confronted with responses hitherto reserved fr professional news outlets, in particular challenges to their authenticity or character" (47)

"instead of abandoning ethnicity and other markers of identity as was originally predicted (Turkle 1995), bloggers and others who participate in online communities deliberately identify themselves in these terms of ethnicity and culture"

5 blogs online since 2002.

Saying that Chinese blogging is a Western imposition assumes that Chinese are not shaping blogosphere and can only conform to existing standards, and that they can't choose how or when to use blogs. (49)

Forums and listservs are pre-blog

"On the Internet, because performing identity depends far more on self-description than on presentation of direct 'evidence', every blogger must make choices about what to reveal and make further decisions about how to illustrate these choices." (50) We can look at choices to see what criteria seem important for defining identity.

#### Russia

History of LiveJournal is intertwined with evolution of Internet in Russia. Early internet conceptualized as grassroots, place for dialogue, domestic kitchen (vs Western 'frontier' or 'superhighway').

Split between pro- and anti-Western influence (individual)

Optimists and pessimists wrt internet and state/society.

Western 'collaborative', Russian 'collectivist'

"Power-play between self-identity and imposed lables" ... users... "suddenly, forcibly and incorrectly labelled as 'Russian'" Different words for Russia in terms of culture and Russian in terms of nation state.

#### Australia

Surprisingly (given cultural, linguistic and political similarities) different from US. "more concerned with responding to commentary seen on fellow bloggers' sites; such commentary may increasingly take place on those sites themselves than at a distance through new posts on one's own blog" (94)

Study measuring types of outgoing links in various blogs and posts but I'm not really sure why. Something about political engagement?

#### Israel

3 leading political Hebrew language blogs, and some English language Israeli-based. Structured interviews with blog founders.

Blog phenomenon: 2001 with Isra-blog, 2003 Notes, 2005 Tapuz's Blogosphere, 2006 WP template to Hebrew and Blogli (WP based)

(Focus is on solely political rather than personal blogs in this chapter). Mass media ignored political blogs. Sometimes reprinted without proper credit. "Blogs are perceived as an expression of the writer's identity as if it is a form of interpersonal interaction within a virtual community representing the publich sphere". Depoliticized.

"American bloggers think that while comments are not a requirement, they do enhance blog content dramatically" (Arrington 2006 Techcrunch: What is the definition of a blog?)

* Herring + Kouper The discursive construction of weblogs 2004

#### Arab (Morocco)

5 Moroccan blogs, Arabic, French and English language.

blogma - local blogging (contrast to rest of Arab world which is pan-Arab)

(hahaha abuse of a female blogger met with alarm and noted as outlier). "Myth" of internet as end of politics.

#### Italy

Grillo - political comedian excluded from mainstream media in 90s. Analysis of his blog for 1 year from 1 May 2005. Has become a lively community for political dissidents.

#### Singapore

Blogs as cultural and personal tools of expression:

* Blanchard 2004 Blogs as virtual communities
* Herring 2005 Conversations in the blogosphere
* Ibrahim 2006 Weblogs as personal narratives
* Nardi 2004 Why we blog

Bloggin popularised due to availability of software and major political events. "Blogs enable the privatization of public events and the publicization of the personal" (173) "cultural tools for expression or personal conduits for public ruminations". blogs "fuse global practices with local agency"

2006 Singapore general election - political blogging played a big role.

-> Applies intertextuality to hypertext

"the cultural context of offline society mediates the readings of text and images that occur online" (Miller and Slater 2000)

"the Internet is an unbound textual space which is always in the process of being produced" (175)

"As a cognitive space it conjoins the virutal and the physical spaces producing new streams of consciousness and dialogism which often locate the social context of these utterances"

Cultural taboos affect narratives. "silent discourse in offline society and the alternative discourses on the Internet"

Individual agency of blog is in direct contrast to political culture in Singapore. "The ability of technology to create new personas as well as strip and reinvent identities means that identity on the Internet cannot be neatly divided into 'insiders' and 'outsiders' or 'citizens' and 'foreigners'" (185)

* "avatarism" Judith 1998 Identity and deception in the virtual community.

"what is contraversial or novel for the community can be influenced by offline societal norms" (189)
