# Progress report

Since the beginning of this year I've been focusing on studying and implementing specifications for decentralised social systems, in particular the specifications which are inputs to the W3C Social Web Working Group (Micropub, Webmention, ActivityPump and SoLiD). A number of short articles describe implementation and analysis progress to date <sup>[1](#implementation)</sup>. I have also worked on comparing two open vocabulary+syntaxes for describing and communicating social activities online (Microformats2 and ActivityStreams2)<sup>[2](#vocabs)</sup>. This has allowed me to identify challenges and points of contention with designing interoperable decentralised social systems from a developers perspective, which (coupled with user-centred research) will inform the recommendations for and implementations of user-empowering decentralised social profiles that are the main contributions of my thesis.

Additionally I have started work on deconstructing the nature of profiles in centralised social systems in order to derive a taxonomy that allows better description and understanding of online presence. Work in progress<sup>[3](#taxonomy)</sup>.

I have continued collaborative work with Dave Murray-Rust and Max van Kleek about online privacy perserving strategies, which feeds into my understanding of the discords and harmonies between social systems and their users. We have conducted further analysis of our survey results about online lying (using a broad definition) habits<sup>[4](#survey)</sup>, and we have recently interviewed 15 people about how they share personal data in social networks. Analysis of results is just starting, but promises interesting insight into how trust and perception of others is affected by technological mediation.

# Summary plan

* Continued work on Social API derived from existing specs, within the context of W3C Social Web WG (first draft of spec due Oct 2015).
* Chapter on analysis of existing social systems and social profiles taxonomy (draft due end of Nov 2015).
* Chapter consolidating literature and existing work on digital self representation (draft due end of Dec 2015).
* Work with developers on the Crosscloud project to build and test decentralised social applications which support data ownership and meet user self representation needs. Create a set of recommendations and guidelines for building interoperable social applications in this way.

# Risk mitigation

* Development and testing of multiple interoperable social applications is ambitious, but possible in conjunction with Crosscloud developers and members of the Social Web WG. I will focus on a single application myself which covers the core requirements of managing a flexible online profile, in order to make sure that at least one is fully complete, and contribute to others as possible.
* If the Social Web WG fails to take the Social API to Rec, further analysis of the barriers encountered would be valuable, and the work done on it in the meantime still useful input into the recommendations in my thesis.
