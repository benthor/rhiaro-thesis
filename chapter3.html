  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The <a href="/thesis/chapter2">previous chapter</a> discusses an individual's relation with their online representation; how users understand profiles; how the affordances of a profile impact the culture of an online community, including how users interact and relate to each other, and how users understand themselves as part of the community. We have established that there are various different (potentially overlapping) perspectives that need to be taken into account when discussion online self-presentation:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Active users of a system, who maintain a profile.</li>
    <li>Passive users of a system, who may not have a profile of their own.</li>
    <li>System designers and developers, who must model and display data about their users.</li>
    <li>Third-party developers who build additional services using data from another system.</li>
    <li>Regulatory bodies which seek to influence or direct how systems are used for legal, ethical or economic reasons.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We have conducted five empirical studies which touch on each of these perspectives to some degree. Each study resulted in a small taxonomy useful for categorising the participants' experiences in each particular context. We conclude by coalescing these taxonomies into an overall framework consisting of five concepts, which we believe are key for describing online self-expression experiences. The framework is summarised here for reference, and we discuss its derivation in the conclusion of this chapter.</p>

    <h3>Overview of studies</h3>
    <p>Hinted at by [@boyd-facid, cite, cite, cite], individuals are rapidly and often intuitively developing coping mechanisms and practices to more effectively manage their online self-presentation and impression management despite the constraints of the tools they use. The first four studies focus on such behaviours through examining:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the practice of deception and lying for impression management in mainstream social media (a survey).</li>
      <li>social systems as tools for mediating reality (a design-fiction interview study).</li>
      <li>the personal branding of creative content producers on YouTube (an empirical analysis of online profiles).</li>
      <li>iimpression management of social media 'makers' who control their social interactions through personal websites (an interview study).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We posit that the technical constraints of a system has an impact on user perceptions of the system, and the culture of the community which uses it. The <a href="#what-is-a-profile">final study</a> asks the question "what is a profile?" and takes an objective look at 20 online systems which employ user profiles in a social capacity to classify their features.</p>

<section id="constructing-online-identity">

  <h2>Constructing online identity</h2>

  <p>This section has been adapted from work published as <em>Constructed Identity and Social Machines: A Case Study in Creative Media Production</em> (2014, Proceedings of WWW, Seoul).</p>

  <p>In {part x} we described existing work in understanding socio-technical systems as Social Machines, and argue that due to the complex nature of online identity, understanding nuanced identity behaviours of Social Machine participants in a more granular way is crucial. Here, we briefly describe <em>creative media production social machines</em>, and present the results of a study of personas portrayed by participants in one of these. We then describe additional dimensions along which a Social Machine can be classified in order to better understand human participants as individuals.</p>

  <p>Amongst the plethora of user-generated content on the web are a huge number of works of creative media, and behind these are independent content creators pushing their work to a global audience and actively seeking to further their reach. Within this ecosystem we can see <em>creative media production social machines</em> on a variety of different scales. The definition of creative media production social machines encompasses a broad class of systems where:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>humans may use a purely digital, or combination of digital and analogue methods, and a degree of creative effort, to produce media content;</li>
    <li>the content is published such that it is publicly accessible on the web;</li>
    <li>a global audience may consume, curate and commentate on this content in technologically-mediated environments.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These social machines exist both within and across content host platforms (eg. YouTube) and within and across online communities and social networks. Many, if not all, media types and genres are represented among the media artefacts that emerge from these systems, and the content combines with its reception to have a sometimes profound effect on media and culture in the offline world.</p>

  <p>Figure \ref{vlog} shows the interconnected social and technical systems engaged when a simple vlog (video blog) is uploaded to YouTube. These processes would be further expanded if the creator was to branch out and produce different types of content, collaborate with another creator, cross-publicise, share audiences or even co-own a YouTube channel or other website profile.</p>

  <p><img src="figs/fig_vlog.eps" alt="Interconnected social and technical systems necessary for publishing a vlog on YouTube.\label{vlog}" /></p>

  <p>Creative media production social machines create an environment in which content creators of all backgrounds and abilities are able to publish outside of the constraints of traditional media channels. These creators are actively vying for attention from the masses; competing for views, likes and shares on a global scale. How they present themselves to their audience can be critical to their success, but also a ground for playful experimentation.</p>

  <p><strong>Motivations for participation</strong></p>

  <p>It is worth noting that there are a variety of motivations or incentives for content creators to participate in these systems.</p>

  <p>Some content host sites provide direct financial incentive for popularity (eg. YouTube's Google Adsense). Others facilitate a commission based model, where creators show off their work and take paid requests for custom pieces from the community (eg. DeviantArt). For content creators who publish primarily on such systems, their activity on other systems is usually tied to driving traffic back to the content which makes them money, or entertaining the fanbase from whom they thrive (eg. a creator who publishes sketch comedy on YouTube might use their Twitter account to tell original jokes to maintain interest in between video releases).</p>

  <p>But for many content creators, the financial rewards from their chosen content host sites might be a convenient side-effect of doing something that they love. Reputation as a creator of high quality content, a talented artist or a particularly funny comedian might be their primary driver. There are also social cues in many communities that affect content creator behaviour. Sometimes creators don't want to be accused of 'pandering' to their audience or losing their artistic integrity, and regulate their behaviour accordingly.</p>

  <p>The visibility of quantitative data collected by a content host site – such as how many views a piece of content has, how often they are referred to as a co-creator, or how often a content creator persona responds to viewer comments – may also impact behaviour. Technical factors are often highly conflated with the social norms in a community.</p>

  <p>Thus, the core reasons for creating content can affect both the content created and how creators present themselves to their audience in the process.</p>

  <section id="context-and-research-questions">
    <h3>Context and research questions</h3>

    <p>The nature of identity and anonymity in online spaces is well discussed \cite{Donath2002, Halpin2006, Rains2007, Ren2012}. Humans naturally adjust the way they present themselves according to the context, and different online spaces may afford different levels of flexibility in doing this. Some systems don't require any kind of registration to post content, allowing people to adopt and discard personas as needed, and to create social cues to identify each other that are not designed as part of the system \cite{Bernstein2011}. Entirely different behaviour occurs in systems that strongly encourage or even try to enforce usage of real names. Often it is trivial for people to create multiple accounts under different pseudonyms anyway, but there may be an increased expectation of honesty from other users of the system, which itself affects the culture of communities within.</p>

    <p>In many cases the fact that people present themselves differently in different contexts is unconscious; a side effect of their participation in a particular system according to the social norms or technical affordances (eg.\ their desired username may be unavailable resulting in the forging of new branding around an alternative). In other cases, the creation of alternative personas is engineered and deliberate, either from the outset or as something that has evolved over time. But, beyond carefully crafting a single identity each, multiple individuals may participate in the portrayal of a single persona \cite{Dalton2013} and one individual may present versions of themselves through <em>multiple</em> personas.</p>
    
    <p>The public profiles of content creators were examined with the following questions in mind:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>How do content creators present themselves within and across communities?</li>
      <li>To what extent are content creators' online presences consistent platforms, and how is their content distributed across different online presences?</li>
      <li>How, and to what extent, do content creators present connections between their own online presences?</li>
    </ol> 
    <p>We also take note of their audience, the type of content they create, and the capabilities of the platforms on which they publish their content, to add context.</p>

    <h3>Study design</h3>

    <p>TODO</p>

    <h4 id="participants">Participants</h4>

    <p>Ten content creators were selected from a subset of creators with whose content we have a passing familiarity through encountering it online over the past months to years. This resulted in a broad spectrum of content types (video, animation, music, art, written word) genres (comedy, game commentaries, educational, political), popularity, well-knownness and activity levels. We deliberately examined content creator profiles from the perspective of a content consumer, or casual audience member. Thus, for the purposes of this study, we do not have access to deeper insight about the personas beyond what is accessible publicly through the web.</p>

  <section id="results">
    <h3>Results</h3>

    <p>The results presented here are based upon a very small (albeit diverse) sample, and cannot be considered representative of content creators in general.</p>

    <h4 id="profiles-and-personas">Profiles and personas</h4>

    <p>For ten content creators, 93 profiles were discovered. Of these, 23 were YouTube channels, 16 Twitter profiles, 13 Facebook, 9 Vimeo, 7 Tumblr, 6 personal websites, 5 Instagram and 4 Vine, 3 Google Plus, 2 Bandcamp and 2 DeviantArt and 1 each of Patreon, FormSpring, BlipTV, and Newgrounds. Table \ref{creators} shows how the profiles are distributed. As we can see, in the domain of creative content production identities are not site- or community-specific. Creators spread their activities across a number of networks in order to shape a more complete identity.</p>

    <p><strong>Table: Distribution of profiles for content creators in the study.</strong></p>

    <p>'Second channels' are common on YouTube. Creators who focus on one type of content (eg.\ sketch comedy) publish this on their main channel as well as using their main channel identity for interactions on the site. On their second channel they publish content that they may consider to be of interest to only a part of their main audience, such as vlogs about their lives, outtakes from main channel content, or experimental pieces. Most content creators with second channels post explicit links to them on their main channel, and often publicise them within content metadata or as part of the content directly. In some cases, including those where the connection between two channels is explicit and obvious, the creators behave differently towards their audience through second channel content. This varies greatly depending on the type of content produced. In some cases, second channels may be perceived as more reflective of the creator's 'true' personality, if they project themselves as more serious or honest, and publish more personal content like vlogs or behind-the-scenes footage. Whether or not this is accurate is impossible to know without intimate knowledge of the creators' offline life of course. The significance is that persona variations exist, and creators do not necessarily hide these alternative presentations of themselves from their audience.</p>

    <p>Additionally, there are profiles which are <em>not</em> directly linked from the (self-identified) 'main' profile, or the links are treated as though to the profile of a different person. Figure \ref{clinks} shows three screenshots of different YouTube channels showing different ways creators link out to other versions of themselves.</p>

    <p><img src="fig_channellinks.eps" alt="Dane transparently links to 3 of his channels, two for alternative content types and one for a character he created.  2. Fred is a character played by Lucas, but the links on Fred's channel treat Lucas as a different person. 3. Andrew Lemming lists Khyan as &quot;Uncle&quot;, although Khyan is the creator of the Andrew Lemming character. \label{clinks}" /></p>

    <p>Creators also used their profiles to link to shared channels (where either multiple creators post content independently of each other, or creators collaborate to produce joint content, or a both), and channels of others with whom they regularly work.</p>

    <p>Most profile host sites offer limited options for customisation, and the use of consistent branding was intermittent. This mostly took the form of identical or similarly styled display pictures, similarly phrased introductory paragraphs, and similarly styled content.</p>

    <p>Some creators have profiles which are distinctly grouped into alternative personas. This was evident from the branding, content and connections between them.</p>

    <h4 id="connections">Connections</h4>

    <!-- Todo: dig up actual results with connection counts and add them here -->

    <p>How connections to other people were represented varied depending on the technical system. We can differentiate between mutual relationships between accounts (eg. 'friend') and one-directional relationships (eg. 'follower', 'subscriber'). Some systems offer both types of relationship, some one or the other. For YouTube channels, popularity ranged from over 3.5 million subscribers for Dane's character channel <em>realannoyingorange</em> to 118 for Bown's secondary <em>bowntalks</em> channel.</p>

    <p>The importance of these connections varies depending on the system as well as on the attitude of the system user. Mutual connections may initially be presumed to indicate a closer relationship, but this is not always the case. Some systems allow users to accept all friend requests en masse, which they may do to please fans, resulting in a lot of essentially meaningless mutual connections. Instead, outbound one-directional connections come in far smaller numbers, and indicate the content creator is particularly interested in the outputs of the other creators they choose to follow. It is normal for content creators to follow other creators with whom they have collaborated.</p>

    <p>Although their use is to some degree shaped by community norms, such connections are strongly influenced by the architecture of the particular website. However in addition, most of the websites examined allow enough control over the textual content of a profile that profile owners can manually create links to other documents on the web. Creators may also be able to adapt the content publishing interfaces to add additional connections (eg. adding links to Twitter and Facebook accounts in the description of a YouTube video), and often do. These connections necessitate extra effort on the part of the content creator, and tell us more about their relationships with other online accounts. Figure \ref{connections} shows different types of connections between profiles and personas for one content creator.</p>

    <p><img src="fig_fred.eps" alt="Lucas Cruickshank was an early YouTube success story through his persona Fred Figglehorn. Here, different types of connections between various online accounts belonging to both Lucas and Fred are illustrated. \label{connections}" /></p>

    <h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

    <p>Content creators at all levels of activity do not have straightforward relationships with the systems they use for publishing and publicising their content. Through manually examining profiles, it is possible to identify personas, and connections between creators, and understand the likely explanations behind them. Currently there is no way to formalise these deductions. Methods for formalisation are useful for gaining a deeper understanding of the actions in this space, as well as for creating machine-readable representations of social machine participants.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="framework-for-understanding-identities-of-social-machine-participants">

    <h3>Framework for understanding identities of social machine participants</h3>

    <p>Based on the findings previously described, we propose four closely linked but distinct concepts that are useful in a granular discussion of identities of social machine participants: roles, attribution, accountability and traceability.  We explain each in the context of creative media production social machines, and show how they can be used as dimensions to assess the nature of individual identity in a social machine.</p>

    <p><strong>Roles</strong></p>

    <p>A creative media production social machine contains consumers, commentators and curators, and creators \cite{Luther2007a}. These roles are interchangeable, and content creators may wish to adopt different personas according to the role they are playing. Plus, content creators are often multi-talented and they may wish to put on a different face according to the different types of content they publish. How easily this is accomplished, according to the social expectations and technical affordances of a system that is part of a social machine, can impact the behaviour of participants.</p>

    <p><strong>Attribution</strong></p>

    <p>In content creation communities, contributions to media output are directly connected to building reputation, so content creators generally desire to have their name attached to work they produce. If the publication system does not allow this directly, as is often the case for sites that host collaborative works (a video published on one YouTube channel may contain contributions from several creators, each with their own channels), then creators adapt the system as best they can (the uploader may list links to the channels of all contributors in the video description) \cite{Luther2010}. Even when a content host site provides automatic linking to other user profiles – common in remixing communities – this isn't necessarily enough. \cite{Monroy-Hernandez2011} finds that human-given credit means more, and so free-text fields for content metadata are often used anyway.</p>

    <p><strong>Accountability</strong></p>

    <p>In many of the oft-discussed social machines, like Wikipedia, Galaxy Zoo, Ushahidi, and the theoretical crime data social machine in \cite{ByrneEvans2013}, accurate data is critical to the usefulness of the output of the system(s). Thus, accountability through identity is important. It is reasonable then to want to regulate participants somehow. But this cannot be universally applicable.</p>

    <p>The production of creative content is a domain that exemplifies the need for taking a more flexible approach to identity understanding and management. On one hand, creators wish to be accurately credited for their work and plagiarism may even result in a financial or reputational loss. On the other hand, creators may appear under multiple guises, engage in diverse behaviours and make contradictory statements about their participation in a creative work, all in the name of entertainment. Creators may also engage in some activities under an alternative identity in order to avoid any effect on the reputation of their main persona. These are valid uses of the anonymity provided by online spaces – a core feature of the World Wide Web – and should be allowed. Such activities won't necessarily even result in diminished trust. A content consumer may fully enjoy a series of vlogs, unaware that the vlogger is a character and the life events portrayed are entirely fictional, and be none the worse off for it.</p>

    <p><strong>Traceability</strong></p>

    <p>We consider traceability in terms of the settings in which an individual might interact with others. A person participating in a creative media production social machine may exist behind a different persona when participating in a scientific discovery social machine, and yet another in a health and well-being social machine. The discovery that other participants in the health and well-being social machine are aware of their alternate persona in the creative media production social machine may cause them to amend one or both of their personas. If the risk of their multiple identities being 'discovered' is high they may adjust their behaviour accordingly, whether this is ceasing all attempts at 'deception', or taking steps to decrease the overlap of the communities of which they are a part.</p>

    <p>Further to this, well known content creators often appear at offline events to meet their fans. Those who star in popular video content are recognised in the street. They are interviewed by journalists and contracted to produce viral adverts by marketing companies. Only with careful control of their online persona can they successfully engage in offline interactions like this. A content creator who appears in poorly-produced videos as an apparently genuine violent drunk and who sends abusive messages to other website users along the same theme to maintain the persona, may not be considered a candidate for a job in broadcast media. Even if in actuality, they have skilfully written and portrayed a believable character.</p>

    <p>An example in which the traceability of personas was crucial is the DARPA Network Challenge \cite{Tang2011}, for which participants needed to provide their 'real life' identities to win the cash prizes. Even if they had operated under pseudonyms during the competition, in order to validate their claims they needed to make known these personas and consolidate them with an identity that would allow them to receive the prize money.</p>

    <p>Knowledge of others present the online and offline spaces in which someone spends time may influence how they establish their personas in these spaces. An evolution of these spaces or a change in the individual's circumstances over time may cause them to revise their personas.</p>

    <h4 id="applying-the-framework">Applying the framework</h4>

    <p>We can apply these concepts to social machines in order to understand the importance of individuals' identities within them. We use some well known social machines as examples for each dimension.</p>

    <p>The <em>roles</em> dimension describes the ease at which participants can change the role they play in a system.</p>

  <section id="conclusion">

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p>We have demonstrated through an empirical study that participants in social machines often have complex relationships with their own self-representation, and with their connections to others in a system. Individuals may have one-to-many or many-to-one relationships with online personas, for a number of different reasons, and with different levels of transparency. We have presented a preliminary framework which allows the degree to which this complexity can affect the overall understanding of a social machine to be assessed along four dimensions: roles, attribution, accountability and traceability.</p>

    <p>All four of these dimensions can be understood to relate to the amount of <em>control</em> a user has over their identity within a system. The role(s) taken on by an individual can be affected by the extent to which an one is able to create and discard identities. Whether participants can be attributed or held accountable for their contributions, and the extent to which one identity can be traced to another, are affected by whether identities are persistent, and whether anonymous contributions are accepted. </p>

    <p>Roles arise through, and may be enforced by, either the technical affordances of a system, or the social expectations of a community (or both). The role(s) an individual chooses to take on may also be affected by their personal motivations, desires or needs. Thus roles are also influenced by the <em>context</em> in which a system is being used.</p>

    <p>Attribution and traceability both relate to the <em>connectivity</em> of a system. Participants may see each others' contributions, and may build reputation accordingly and present a particular impression to their audience. This reputation and impression can translate to other technically disconnected systems if identities are transparently linked.</p>

    <p>Traceability of identities, whether intended or not, can <em>cascade</em> across the Web and feed into a broader network of data about an individual, which may have unforeseen consequences in the future.</p>

  <h2>Social Media Makers</h2>

  <p>The Web today is a very different place than the one imagined by its creator, Tim Berners-Lee~\cite{weavingtheweb}.  Instead of a vast network of individuals running their own web servers to host homepages or share information, most people simply navigate to Twitter to tweet, log in to Facebook to post a status update, use Wordpress.com to write up their thoughts. With a daily active user poulation of over 1.13 billion\footnote{https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2016/Facebook-Reports-Second-Quarter-2016-Results/default.aspx}, Facebook alone constitutes a full quarter of all Web traffic\footnote{http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/04/facebook-is-eating-the-internet/391766/}. </p>

  <p>However, there are individuals who in certain ways reject the massive social platforms that have swallowed the Web. Instead, they embrace 'home-grown' approaches to building their own web presences, much like the 'old days of the Web. But unlike the old days, when such a presence might have comprised a homepage, such 'DIY Web' hackers now piece together their own bespoke social and data management platforms, akin to the kinds of services offered by social platforms, for managing their interactions and identities online. Often, such capabilities are realised by using an ensemble of open source tools supported by developers with like interests. However, the various motivations for these individuals, and the perspectives they have gained from doing so have, thus far, not been studied extensively.</p>

  <p>In the previous section we examined how individuals who participate in massive, centralised online communities present themselves and manage their interactions with an audience. In this section, we present a study which seeks to understand what drives individuals who <em>avoid</em> mainstream social platforms to find other ways to present themselves online, as well as a descriptive characterisation of their digital spaces. We targeted a broad class of self-described <em>digital makers</em>: those who identify with taking a hands-on 'DIY' approach to meet their own immediate online social interaction and self-presentation needs. We conducted semi-structured interviews supported by live demonstrations of participants' own systems and their social media profiles, to address the following questions:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>What are the main motivations of digital makers in replacing or supplementing mainstream social media use with their own personal  systems?</li>
    <li>How do their uses of (if any) and feelings about mainstream social media compare and contrast with their own personal sites?</li>
    <li>What challenges do digital makers face regarding competing discourses from different social contexts, and how do they address these?</li>
  </ol>

    <h3>Study Design</h3>

    <p>With the wide availability of different social platforms, people often
tend to use one or more to manage their online social activities
{[}cite{]}. Different platforms are tailored to various types of
preferences, philosophies and purposes, and target different communities
and individuals needs (social, professional, leisure). In this research
we are interested in identifying and investigating individuals who
desire the same 'type' of interactions that come through using
mainstream social networking sites, but maintain their own platform
(e.g. blog or website) as the focal point for, and primary source of,
their online activities.</p>

    <p>We designed interview questions to encourage participants to reflect on
their activities, rather than just recount them. The intention was not
to compare their experiences with particular systems, but rather their
motivations and habits, and ideas and feelings about the ways in which
they interact online.</p>

    <section id="smm-participants">
      <h4>Participant Recruitment</h4>

      <p>From the existing literature we can see similarities and differences in
habits and motivations of bloggers and social media users. What we
haven't heard about are social media `makers', who occupy some space in
between.</p>

      <p>Such individuals must be technically competent or willing and able to
learn. They share the DIY attitude with maker communities who engage in
physical/hardware ... described by .. as ... {[}cites{]} but
in the digital realm. In the same way hardware hackers seek to
understand and control their physical day-to-day environment {[}cite{]},
digital makers who see social media as a core part of their everyday
lives are engaging in similar practices online.</p>

      <p>Social media makers are different too from the open source software
developers who work on decentralised social platforms like GNU Social,
Friendica, pump.io or Diaspora. That's not to say they are mutually
exclusive and indeed many participate in several projects which are
relevant to their interests in this space; but makers focus on building
systems which affect their own lives primarily, and for use by others,
secondarily.</p>

      <p>We recruited suitable participants through distributing an online signup
form in IRC channels and online forums known to be frequented by
individuals engaged in building personal websites and social media
systems, and asking those who responded to refer others they know. The
signup form included a brief description of suitable
participants so that people were able to self-select for the study.</p>

      <p>The signup form asked for demographic information (age, gender,
occupation, ethnicity, country of residence) as well as a list of
personal websites and social media sites they use on a regular basis.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="smm-study-method">
      <h4>Study Method</h4>

      <p>Participants were asked 7 opening or closing questions, and a set of 5
questions about each of their personal sites and each of their social
media profiles, so the total number of questions depended on the number
of personal sites and social platforms they used. We enquired about
their motivations for building their own platforms, the particular
functions they use them for, and about their audience. We asked
similarly about how they use social networking sites, their audiences
there, and how the functionality and audience overlap or differ between
their personal sites and different social networking sites.</p>

      <p>We conducted semi-structured interviews in order to gain a first-hand
account of participants' experiences with building and using their
personal social media systems. We used the list of sites and systems
gathered during recruitment as a starting point and encouraged
participants to click around their websites and profiles during the
interview, and we recorded a screencast of the process. This served as a
prompt for both the interviewer and participant which allowed us to
tailor the conversation around the participant's particular experiences.
It also aided participants in accurately recalling the systems they use,
as well as backing up their anecdotes with specific examples from their
personal sites or social streams. We also allowed participants to show
and discuss sites they had not initially reported if they wanted to do
so.</p>

      <p>The interviews took place across a variety of different locations
convenient to the individual participants. All but one participant used
their own laptops when viewing their websites and social media profiles,
so things were set up how they were used to day to day. Participants
were permitted to pause the screen recording and/or audio at any time
during the interview if it made them more comfortable.</p>

      <p>We used open ended questions as a guideline, but allowed participants to
deviate freely to other topics if prompted by one of the questions, or
something on their screen.</p>

      <p>Participants were rewarded with a &dollar;15 gift voucher for their time.</p>

    <section id="smm-trustworthiness-of-data">
      <h4>Trustworthiness of data</h4>

      <p>While qualitative semi-structured interview is the appropriate method to
gather people's different types of usages, motivating factors and
associated examples, it also presents several challenges. Qualitative
data gathering may suffer from a lack of detailed or accurate
recollection of events; participants might report their perception or
general trends instead of specific descriptions of their activities, and
may be unable to report on unconscious influences or motivations.
Participants may also deliberately withhold or distort information.
Using this methodology some information can be misinterpreted or
overlooked.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Detailed recollection of use: We asked participants to visit their
  sites and profiles and answer questions based on what was on screen.
  This was done in order to situate their reasons and preferences with
  concrete examples, and to be able to interpret their responses in
  context, and enquire further prompted by what was visible if
  necessary.</li>
        <li>Perceptions vs. actual actions: In order to gather users' activities
  accurately we asked them to provide specific examples to support their
  responses, which they were able to show us on their screen.</li>

        <li>Witholding or distorting information: Participants were informed that
  they could decline to answer any question, or could answer questions
  without being recorded, in order to mitigate against their feeling
  obliged to provide any response to questions they may uncomfortable
  with. Participants were able to answer vaguely if they preferred,
  rather than giving granular detail that may be inaccurate.</li>
        <li>Detailed information required vs. study length: In order to avoid a
  fatigue effect we asked participants to start with their personal
  sites, and then prioritised the social media platforms they felt they
  used the most. The study session was scheduled to run for 60 minutes,
  with an additional 30 minutes buffer for participants who wished to
  talk for longer.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="smm-analysis">
      <h4>Analysis</h4>

      <p>We take a grounded theory approach to analysing the data gathered.</p>

      <p>Immediately following each interview, the interviewer recorded pertinent
words or phrases and notable highlights from the discussion, as well as
a general impression. These notes were compiled into a preliminary set
of codes in order to begin the process of identifying potential themes.
We carried out inductive thematic analysis on the interview responses in
several stages:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Listening to the interview recordings and transcribing to
  re-familiarise with the responses. Taking snapshots from the screen
  recording to include in the transcript when something on screen was
  explicitly referred to.</li>
        <li>Coding the transcripts, beginning with the list of phrases from the
  initial interview notes, but adding to this list throughout. Each
  transcript was passed through at least twice and re-coded to account
  for new codes which emerged later during the process.</li>
        <li>Noting relationships between the codes and how they co-occur, and
  categorising the codes to identify broader themes.</li>
        <li>Reviewing themes to understand how they overlap or relate to one
  another, and refining them to make sure themes are distinct.
  Identifying related topics which are missing from the data.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>We organise our results section according to the derived themes.</p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section id="smm-results">
    <h3>Results</h3>

    <p>13 interviews were conducted in person, and 2 over video chat. 10 of
these took place during or after one of three technical events,
conveniently over the same week in nearby cities, which were of interest
to and therefore well attended by our target participants.</p>

    <p>All participants work or study in the technology industry, which is
typical of our ``social media makers'' target, though not all work in
web development. 11 participants identified as male, 3 as female and one
declined to answer. A majority of participants are white; two listed
their ethnicity as Hispanic or Latino, one as Jewish and one as Asian,
and two declined to respond. All are resident in North America or
Europe. These biases are reflective of the technology industry and the
routes through which we were able to recruit participants. Our target
community is niche and in its early stages, and as such our recruiting
options were limited, so we acknowledge that the conclusions we draw
from our results cannot be generalised to a broader population.</p>

    <p>Interviews lasted between 45 and 90 minutes, and participants discussed
between 1 and 4 personal websites, and between 1 and 9 social
networking sites (mean 4.7). Some paused screen recording when typing in passwords
or if they were interrupted by incoming chat messages when browsing
social media. None paused the recording in order to show the interviewer
something 'off the record'.</p>

    <p>Participants talked about a combination of personal social experiences
both on and offline, including how their online activities affect or are
affected by their every day lives; their feelings about others working
or experimenting in the decentralised social web domain; things they
have accomplished and things they want or plan to accomplish in future;
and technical details of systems they have built themselves. In many
cases, participants naturally held a discussion which covered answers to
our guideline questions without explicit prompting.</p>

    <p>Across all of the participants there was diversity in both systems used and the main emphases of conversation, however there are many common threads around <em>control</em> and <em>audience</em>, which we discuss here.</p>

    <p><blockquote>"As long as I've known that it's possible to publish creative works I have... Once I realised that I can't trust others to have my own best interests in mind I started having my own websites." - Participant L</blockquote></p>

    <section id="results-the-network">
      <h4>The network</h4>

      <p>All participants maintained personal sites, and all used profiles on one
or more major centralised social media services. All but one
participant cross-posted content from their personal site to social
media sites to some degree, referring to this process as
``syndication'', which may be manual or automatic.
All participants said they need centralised services in order to reach their social
network(s), as they did not expect their friends and family to go out of
their way to read their personal website on a regular basis. Participant K had been involved in various open source social network projects, but missed his regular contacts: ``I was originally in like the GNU Social and Disapora... they didn't make a ton of sense because I didn't know anybody that was on them.'' Participant J agreed that he had looked at some open source projects, but didn't like their ``wholesale rejection of silos'' because his friends were still using centralised systems and he wants them to read the things he writes.</p>

    <p><blockquote>"Most of my friends are in silos, I want to be in those conversations and interact with them there, but I also want the control of both the data and the presentation... It's about interacting with people in silos while not being locked up in silos" (M)</blockquote></p>

    <p>However,
most participants did not simply copy all content to all networks
indiscriminately but employed a variety of policies when deciding which
posts to syndicate where.</p>

    <p><strong>Contents:</strong> is the media or data or length of text
contained in this post consistent with the type of content generally
posted to this site? This could be a cultural constraint, or a technical
restriction. Participant M says content must ``fit in'' so any inconsistencies from what's expected don't distract from the content itself. Participant E makes collages of photos to post because ``this is generally what people do on Pinterest'' and F points out the ``unspoken rules about what goes on there and how people interact''.</p>

    <p>Does the content cover a subject appropriate
to discuss on the third-party platform? Participant N wouldn't write academic things on Facebook for fear of boring people.</p>

    <p><strong>Frequency of posts:</strong> Almost 75\% of participants were worried about
creating undue ``noise''. For example, only carefully selected photos
are generally posted to Instagram, but a whole, uncurated set is
uploaded to Flickr.</p>

    <p><blockquote>``On twitter nobody cares if you're too noisy, but on facebook they
really do, they start complaining.'' (B)</blockquote></p>
    <p><blockquote>``I don't want to post too much and like dominate someone's feed... I wanted to post 20 photos today and I definitely feel a pressure not to do that because it's [being syndicated to] Instagram'' (I)</blockquote></p>

    <p><strong>Who will see it:</strong> is the content of the post appropriate for the
connections they know they have on the third-party platform? Will the
content be distributed publicly or privately on this platform? Is the
anticipated level and type of engagement with the content by others
desirable?</p>

    <p>Participant B uses Medium to reach to people beyond his normal circles
of ``affluent white men who work in tech''. Participant F withholds
certain content from Facebook to avoid social-media-novice family
members making unrelated personal comments which all of her other
contacts can see. Participant I keeps his social media profiles fully
private, even though they mirror the public content posted on his
personal site, considering the interactions on Twitter ``too abusive and
spammy'' for it to be worthwhile letting strangers comment on his posts.</p>

    <p><strong>What will it look like:</strong> 70\% think about how
their content would be rendered on other networks when deciding whether
to syndicate there, for example that short text-only notes look
unappealing on facebook, but images and link previews are presented
well, so they only syndicate content to facebook when it includes the
latter.</p>

    <p>Even when posting primarily on their own website, the importance of the
network means that participants are still bound to some extent by the
norms and expectations of the communities and platforms used by their
friends and contacts. Most participants found more freedom in posting to
their own sites with regards to types of posts, content and posting
frequency. However
those who were more committed to cross-posting, or did not have tooling
available to allow them to be selective about cross-posting, were
strongly influenced by the other destinations for their content when
making posting decisions, in some cases self-censoring their content or
amending how it is presented.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="results-decompartmentalisation">
      <h4>(De)compartmentalisation and audience</h4>

      <p>One third of participants said they do not think about their audience, but 7 described how they are very aware of who might be reading their content, including that they revise content until they feel it is appropriate for multiple audiences they imagine might see it. 5 people say they primarily post for themselves, and 4 said that whilst they selectively
cross-post subsets of content based on the norms and audience of third-party platforms, they actively want to collapse these contexts on their own site.</p>

      <p><blockquote>``I'm ready to collapse everything... I want to be as complete as possible... It'd be fun if I had a blog that's part let's say... Swift coding, and also part cute beefcake pictures.'' (J)</blockquote></p>

      <p>Some would consider filtering based on who was looking, if it was technically straightforward. However most don't care at all about audiences from different aspects of their lives coming across their posts, or imagine the audience for their site is so small that context collapse is unlikely. Some people even saw this as positive, describing it as ``healthy'' (M, I) or ``more human'' (I). 4 acknowledged their privilege as non-vulnerable members of society which allowed them to feel this way.</p>

      <p>Despite this, 7 participants said they post pseudonymously or anonymously in other systems which are completely disconnected from their primary online identity. This is usually about sensitive topics that they are not willing to share more broadly, and don't trust their own technical expertise to build sufficent access control into their own systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="results-self-expression">
      <h4>Self-expression</h4>

      <p>Despite the uses for centralised systems in terms of network reach and audience management, one aspect of \emph{control} desired by participants is how they are able to express themselves.</p>

      <p><strong>Self-expression through visuals: </strong>Participants cared a lot about what their websites look like. Three quarters said
that having creative control over the appearance of their content was
one of their main motivations for publishing on their own site. For
some, this stemmed from wanting `clean and simple' visuals as opposed to
the `noisy' interfaces of Facebook and Twitter. For others, it was
important that they had freedom to experiment.</p>

      <p><blockquote>``I like playing with the form. I think the thing about cookie cutter
sites is that they are one size fits all. And I think form in some ways
dictates content and so if you're publishing on a network things you are
writing are lead by what's already on the network. If you've got your
own site it's like starting form scratch you can just dictate exactly
what's there, you can choose your own identity, you can have a huge say
over what you're publishing.'' - B</blockquote></p>

      <p>Participant L showed other peoples' sites he was inspired by visually,
including one which uses a unique design for each individual blog post.
Participant N publishes his art on his site - alongside his technical and academic essays - which involves running code, so he is unable to use existing platforms.</p>

      <p>Participant I has archives dating back over a decade, and for many years
experimented with a different design every month. These designs are
frozen in time, so
clicking back through these archives reveals radical changes in visuals
which capture moods, ideas and experiments from the time the posts were
written: </p>

      <p><blockquote>``I could easily try out a new style knowing that I
wasn't committing all my archives or the future to this style.'' He was
convinced these temporal visuals were ``worth preserving'' by his own
memories of blog posts he'd read looking a certain way, and the
associations or even nostalgia that come with that when articles are
re-discovered. The same participant periodically makes time-limited
or post-specific updates to his visual style, and compares this with the way 
people change their profile pictures on social media to support a 
particular cause.</blockquote></p>

        <img src="creative_styles.png"/>
        <figcaption>Examples of participant websites who used their own space to express themselves in ways they can't with centralised services.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>When interacting with others in their community, participants may post a message on their own site which triggers a notification to the addressee, who will often display the reply. Despite their strong feelings over how their posts are presented on their own site or on social media, no participants whose replies are displayed on another <em>homegrown</em> site were concerned with how their message is presented there, so long as the content itself is unchanged. The domain owner is within their rights to display incoming content in their own space however they see fit.</p>

      <p><strong>Self-expression through voice: </strong>Over half of participants were worried about their self expression being 
compromised through censorship or not being able to use their own voice.
One participant, only recently returned to personal publishing, stopped
posting on his own site and on social media for several years after a
post about his gay relationship resulted in an
unpleasant message from his father. As he became increasingly reclusive
online, this started to reflect into his offline life as well, and he
withdrew socially. Recently he realised this wasn't healthy and made a
concerted effort to become more expressive, more confident in his identity
and to be ``forward'' about his experiences as a queer software developer.
Following this, he very deliberately won't be concealing parts
of himself going forward. He now finds ``joy in intersections'' of the different
parts of his life and adds that on your own domain, ``no-one can tell you that you can't call yourself whatever you want.''</p>

      <p>Participant L cares deeply about the visuals of his site, but ultimately sees 
them as something that will change: ``content will always represent me more than any visual design will, because visual designs come and go.'' As a result, he does not display any content created by others: ``I want every pixel on my site to be mine.''</p>

      <p><strong>Self-expression through functionality: </strong>60\% of participants appreciate the ability to create types of content that
no other social systems allow, and to mix and match the types of content they 
post all in one place, agreeing with the sentiment: "it's my site I can post whatever I want" (I). 11 participants described things they do with their own systems that they cannot get elsewhere, including adding licenses (L), editing or deleting posts (I, O), posting events or RSVPs (A, I), custom lists, logs or channels (A, E, G, K, L).</p>

    </section>

    <section id="results-empowerment">
      <h4>Empowerment</h4>
      <p>Participants varied in how they felt their personal sites empowered them, beyond self-expression.
For some it was about ownership. Participant J expressed concern that his generation rarely own things, from cars and houses, to music, and his personal site was a way of claiming something back: ``my personal website at the center or origin of my ideas... it's like expanding my own real estate.''</p>

      <p>However participant B pointed out that ``owning your own stuff is only useful if you can actually control it... if you're not a developer that's actually disempowering'' and participant L describes personal data ownership as ``a tool toward autonomy. Just owning a lot of stuff doesn't give you control or freedom or agency.''</p>

      <p>75\% want a place under their control to be the <em>canonical</em> source of their content; the definitive location for their online persona. Participant I's personal site is entirely public, yet his social media profiles - to where all of his posts are syndicated - are locked down, ``to encourage people, if they wanted to share something that I tweeted, to then share my original copy instead on my website.''</p>

      <p>12 participants expressed the importance of being able to archive their 
content and data. They wanted copies. If a centralised service disappears or bars their access - something which has happened at some point to every participant - most now have their content and often the context of conversations with others, on their own servers. Participant G ``had no idea Geocities would go away.''</p>

      <p>For some, this is also about personal development, reflection, and spotting patterns in their behaviour over time. ``I like being able to have a record of everything I've published over the last ten years and being able to come back to it and go oh this is what I thought about this back then'' (B). Participant L thinks we should take a 2000 year view of our digital lives, and that we all have a right to store personal data ``cradle-to-grave... that will live on untouched after our death'' to benefit future societies.</p>

    <section id="results-ephemerality">
      <h4>Ephemerality</h4>
      <p>Nonetheless, 7 participants create content with the expectation that it
will disappear, and see value in being able to do this, and 4 participants explicitly consider social media to be a place for ephemeral content. ``I feel that I'm much more responsible for what I post... whereas on twitter you're part of the faceless hoarde'', said F, explaining why she posts throwaway or snarky comments to twitter without bothering to archive them in her own space. Many participants treat facebook replies and likes the same way: ``if it's a comment on someone else's post I'm assuming it's pretty much throwaway. I write assuming it could last forever, but I also write assuming that if it got deleted for any reason I wouldn't care... doublethink'' (I). However several participants expressed that they would archive certain types of content if they could, but at present the technical barrier is too high, and their priority for doing so is too low.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="results-consent">
      <h4>Consent</h4>
      <p>Another aspect of control is consent. Many members of the community use common tooling to fetch replies from social media to the syndicated copies of their posts. There are privacy safeguards in the tooling that prevent private or access controlled posts from being exposed publicly, but 4 participants either didn't do this, despite a desire for archives, or expressed misgivings about the fact they were: ``it feels a little bit weird to be pulling people's stuff without their consent'' (B) because most contacts on social media were unaware of the possibility that their content would be copied to somewhere else on the Web; somewhere potentially more likely to be indexed by search engines.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="results-abuse-and-surveillance">
      <h4>Abuse and surveillance</h4>
      <p>Participant B once posted something which triggered a flood of reactions
from an infamously abusive online community. His tooling automatically pulled these 
responses from social media, through to his personal site. Rather exercising
his ability to remove these posts, he ``decided to keep it up and sort of showcase the idiots.'' Other participants consider themselves lucky not to have experienced
this, and give little thought to how they would handle it.</p>

      <p>Though 7 participants ``don't write sensitive stuff on digital technology'' (N) none expressed concern about centralised systems mining the data they syndicate, or the terms of service they are agreeing to in doing so.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="results-inspiration">
      <h4>Inspiration and triggers</h4>
      <p>Almost all participants said they were inspired by others in the community, and other personal sites they see on the Web. Some took specific ideas to do with visuals or the types of content they can post; others were just inspired by the movement towards data ownership in general. Some participants said they replicated features they like from centralised services.</p>

      <p>Half of participants said they built new functionality into their systems when their current way of doing something became too painful or inconvenient. Others want to keep up with the trends in the community in general, so they implement new features in order to continue interoperating with others, or just to try things out. Many said they update their systems when they have enough free time to do so, and have long todo lists of things they want to achieve.</p>

      <p>Most were triggered to update their bios on both their personal sites and across their social media profiles when something changed in their life. Except for participant O, who updated specifically when he realised he would need to give his URL(s) to someone and didn't want his information to be out of date.</p>

  <section id="smm-conclusion">
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The ``digital makers'' we interviewed revealed their primary motivations 
in replacing or supplementing mainstream social media use with their own
personal systems are <em>control</em> of their online representation, and
over the longevity (or not) of their content, and <em>decompartmentalising</em> or 
making a canonical source for all aspects of their online presence.</p>

    <p>Participants who feel over-constrained by the limitations of social media 
with regards to the kinds of content they can create and how it must be laid out 
or displayed have developed their own completely custom publishing environments 
in order to more freely express themselves. They demonstrate many creative 
ways of displaying similar types of content to that ordinarily found on 
social media, as well as innovating with new ``post types'' or ways of sharing 
information that they cannot do elsewhere at all. This freedom to experiment 
leads them to reflect on and perhaps better understand their identities. Further, participants feel 
empowered by the ability to archive their content for life, or hide or remove content from their own 
space as they like.</p>

    <p>Participants remain in touch with their network through cross-posting
content to mainstream social media channels, and in some cases backfeeding interactions 
and conversation threads from there to their own personal sites. A result of this 
is that the content they post is still influenced by the platforms they know it will 
end up being seen on. A technique to mitigate against
violating norms on other platforms or encountering technical barriers is to be selective
when cross-posting. Though there is no hard and fast formula to follow, participants
commonly consider audience, visuals, content types, posting frequency, and topics as part of a gut intuition when making these decisions.</p>

<section id="what-is-a-profile">
  <h2>What is a profile?</h2>

  <p>In order to build on our understanding of the role an online profile plays in self-presentation, identity and interaction we need a more nuanced understanding of what a ‘profile’ <em>is</em> in a general sense. What is the <em>meaning</em> of a profile? We undertake an empirical analysis of digital representations of users on 20 different online systems. From these we derive a set of constructs to capture the most important features of profiles in online systems and evaluate this framework by classifying a further 10 systems according to it (or something). We propose this as groundwork for deriving requirements for profiles when designing new systems which need digital representations of their users, as well as for assessing the benefits and drawbacks of how profiles are implemented in existing systems in such a way that takes into account the contexts in which they are used.</p>
  <p class="notes">Maybe use stuff in participation and interaction of social machines taxonomy http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/362359/1/SOCIAM%20Classificationv2.pdf Could see this as a further breakdown of one of the U categories (see also their methodology pg 13) “Given the value of taxonomies in advancing our understanding of the conceptual landscape associated with a domain”. Taxonomy is very sort of task/activity centric rather than about individuals.</p>

  <p>What are potential variants in how profiles are formed which influence a community (and vice versa)?</p>

  <section id="method">
    <h3>Method</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Study: Start with questions to answer about profiles on different sites; refine questions with progress; find overlaps, similarities, differences; turn this into a framework for categorisation/comparison of types of profile. Probably an actual named method for this.</li>
      <li>Justify selection of starting 20 sites:
        <ul>
          <li>Alexa?</li>
          <li>Social Machines classifications?</li>
          <li>Some dimensions to try to cover, like purpose, user base, business model, ..</li>
          <li>types of social media from a classification, eg. Kaplan &amp; Haenlein 2010, White 2014</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Evaluation: apply taxonomy to more. Selection how?</li>

  <p>do we run a risk of losing out on the collaborative aspects of identity construction if we designs decentralised systems which aren't sufficiently federated? Must acknowledge the criticality of interaction for identity formation.</p>

  <p>Misuse of systems by content creators, 'liars', etc. Replacement of functions of systems by developers. What can we learn from these.</p>
