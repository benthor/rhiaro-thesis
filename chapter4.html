<section id="introduction" rel="schema:hasPart">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div>
    <p>This chapter presents a survey of decentralised social systems: systems which store data about a person, their attributes and activities, and encourage sharing of this data and interactions with others in the network. These systems are analysed along various axes to determine their intended function, fitness for purpose and how they are or were ultimately used and to what extent. The core focus is on treatment of individuals as users of or participants in a system, and I classify systems according to their approach to handling user identities and profile data. I derive modules of decentralised social systems and the contexts in which they are likely to work well and benefit users; I also attempt to identify gaps and common pitfalls in existing theoretical and practical work.</p>
    <p>I finish by describing the most recent work (still ongoing at the time of writing) of the W3C Social Web Working Group, which is producing standards for decentralised social interactions on the Web.</p>

    <section id="scope" rel="schema:hasPart">
      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <div>
        <p>I would love for this chapter to be a complete history of decentralised social networks, but that would take many years to research and write. There exist many partial histories, glimpses into the past through the lens of some masters thesis or an ancient blog post found through archive.org by someone who was There At The Time. These people are even around today, and could be interviewed, if one was so inclined. Efforts towards decentralising social networks have been going on for as long as there have been social networks, and making use of a wide variety of different technologies, such as SMTP, XMPP, peer-to-peer architectures and the Blockchain. Many efforts in academic, commercial or FOSS environments are driven by producing secure private systems (ie. keeping messages transmitted over the network hidden from all but the sender and recipient), or by producing optimised, fast, highly scalable architectures.</p>
        <p>Given the topic of this thesis, I constrain the contents of this chapter in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>to systems on the Social <em>Web</em>; that is, which operate over HTTP, and</li>
          <li>to reports which center the 'user' as a human being, rather than a node; that is I will not cover projects which focus on a purely network architecture perspective.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="def-decentralisation" rel="schema:hasPart">
      <h3>Decentralisation</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Decentralisation is a fairly contentious term with different definitions or understandings depending on the background of the person talking about it. In this thesis, I use the definition from [<a href="#ref-halpin16">halpin16</a>]:</p>
        <blockquote><p>A system in which multiple authorities control different components and no single authority is fully trusted by all others. Decentralized systems are a subset of distributed systems.</p></blockquote>
        <p>This differentiates decentralised systems from <em>distributed</em> systems, which are not necessarily decentralised, in that the latter "may be managed by a single root of trust or authority."</p>

<section id="social-and-personal-datastores" rel="schema:hasPart">
  <h2>Social (and) Personal Datastores</h2>
  <div>
    <p>The data stored may be distinctly personal, shared with third-parties only in specific contexts for a particular purpose; or it may be inherantly social, expected to be broadcast on creation to at least one other person and possibly subject to further reshaping, sharing, and propagation throughout a network of people. Many datastores are optimised for one or the other of these scenarios and may place constraints on their users accordingly; others attempt to meet requirements for both types of data and encounter different implementation and usability challenges as a result.</p>

    <section id="from-status-updates-to-microblogging-and-beyond" rel="schema:hasPart">
      <h3>From status updates to microblogging, and beyond</h3>
      <div>
        <p>There was some point when everyone (planning/discussing decentralised systems) was referring to ‘status updates’ and I think twitter maybe switched the terminology to ‘microblogging’ but now, with AS2 and stuff, I feel like all content is being modelled equally and there’s less trying to enumerate all types of content, and awareness of a need for extensibility. This is pertinent to the idea that a stream of content contributes just as much to a person’s online presentation as a set of attributes. Status updates were kind of ‘my current state’ which is distinctly something at the top of a profile, like ‘about me right now’, but microblogging keeps a feed of past states very visible as well.</p>

<section id="socialwg" rel="schema:hasPart">
  <h2>The Social Web Working Group</h2>
  <div>

    <p class="todo">Turn this into just a survey of specs and supporting technologies, and implementations.</p>
    <p>From the outset, the Social Web Working Group was chartered to produce technical specifications. Prior work, all of which is amongst that mentioned in chapter 4, were noted as building blocks, whether as technical solutions or social experience. Many members of the working group were involved or experienced with some of the prior work, as well.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, the Social Web Working Group has produced the following recommendations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>ActivityStreams 2.0 Core and Vocabulary</strong>: A JSON data model and syntax for social content and interactions, with extensibility based on JSON-LD.</li>
      <li><strong>ActivityPub</strong>: An API for creating content, delivering notifications, and managing common side-effects of interactions within social networks, based on ActivityStreams 2.0.</li>
      <li><strong>Linked Data Notifications</strong>: An API for delivering and reusing generic notifications, based on JSON-LD.</li>
      <li><strong>Micropub</strong>: An API for creating content, based on microformats2.</li>
      <li><strong>Webmention</strong>: An API for delivering notifications when a resource on the Web refers to the URL of another.</li>
      <li><strong>WebSub</strong>: An API for managing and fulfilling subscription requests to Web content (formally known as PubSubHubbub).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And the following Working Group notes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>JF2</strong>: An alternative JSON syntax and vocabulary for representing social objects, based on microformats2.</li>
      <li><strong>Post-type Discovery</strong>: An algorithm for converting between implicitly typed social objects (like JF2) to explicitly typed ones (like ActivityStreams 2.0).</li>
      <li><strong>Social Web Protocols</strong>: A guide to the specifications produced by the group, including how they overlap or complement each other.</li>
    </ul>

    <section id="socialwg-implementations" rel="schema:hasPart">
      
      <h3>Implementations</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Each of the recommendations has received a number of implementations during the Working Group's lifetime. Some were formally submitted to the Working Group as implementation reports whilst the specifications were undergoing review. This section surveys and briefly describes the implementations to date.</p>
