title: Chapter 3 - Social Semantics
---

# Social Semantics

## Introduction

This chapter primarily examines existing implementations of social profiles, to find out what works and what's missing (compared to needs identified in ch2).

## Background

Literature

* self through attributes, various small studies
* ontologies

## Defining an online profile

### Method

* Study: Start with questions to answer about profiles on different sites; refine questions with progress; find overlaps, similarities, differences; turn this into a framework for categorisation/comparison of types of profile. Probably an actual named method for this.
* Justify selection of starting 20 sites (Alexa? Social Machines classifications? Some dimensions to try to cover, like purpose, user base, business model, ..)
* Evaluation: apply taxonomy to more. Selection how?

### Limitations

* Western bias
* Frequency of changes

### Results

WIP:

* http://rhiaro.co.uk/2015/06/what-profile
* https://github.com/rhiaro/profiles/blob/master/study.md

(Maybe a summary/table, and raw results go in an appendix)

### Taxonomy

Something coherant and useful, hopefully.

### Evaluation

Apply taxonomy

## Conclusions
