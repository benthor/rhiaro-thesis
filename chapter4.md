# Standardising Social Profiles

## Social (and) Personal Datastores

Here we present a survey of decentralised systems which store data about a person, their attributes and activities. The data stored may be distinctly personal, shared with third-parties only in specific contexts for a particular purpose; or it may be inherantly social, expected to be broadcast on creation to at least one other person and possibly subject to further reshaping, sharing, and propagation throughout a network of people. Many datastores are optimised for one or the other of these scenarios and may place constraints on their users accordingly; others attempt to meet requirements for both types of data and encounter different implementation and usability challenges as a result.

## People on the Social Web

Background on how identity fits into decentralised social web picture and standards work. Typically for auth, with representation of user secondary or not covered. What's missing to do with profiles/people from previous identity-related standards work? What problems has this caused? Critique based on findings in chs 2 & 3.

* Criteria for good decentralised, interoperable social profiles.
* Spec (probably [not?] part of SocialWG specs).
* Evaluation fo spec against criteria because apparently this is okay.
