  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div>
    <p>The <a href="/thesis/chapter2">previous chapter</a> discusses an individual's relation with their online representation; how users understand profiles; how the affordances of a profile impact the culture of an online community, including how users interact and relate to each other, and how users understand themselves as part of the community. We have established that there are various different (potentially overlapping) perspectives that need to be taken into account when discussion online self-presentation:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Active users of a system, who maintain a profile.</li>
      <li>Passive users of a system, who may not have a profile of their own.</li>
      <li>System designers and developers, who must model and display data about their users.</li>
      <li>Third-party developers who build additional services using data from another system.</li>
      <li>Regulatory bodies which seek to influence or direct how systems are used for legal, ethical or economic reasons.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We have conducted five empirical studies which touch on each of these perspectives to some degree. Each study resulted in a small taxonomy useful for categorising the participants' experiences in each particular context. We conclude by coalescing these taxonomies into an overall framework consisting of five concepts, which we believe are key for describing online self-expression experiences. The framework is summarised here for reference, and we discuss its derivation in the conclusion of this chapter.</p>

      <h3>Overview of studies</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Hinted at by [@boyd-facid, cite, cite, cite], individuals are rapidly and often intuitively developing coping mechanisms and practices to more effectively manage their online self-presentation and impression management despite the constraints of the tools they use. The first four studies focus on such behaviours through examining:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>the practice of deception and lying for impression management in mainstream social media (a survey).</li>
          <li>social systems as tools for mediating reality (a design-fiction interview study).</li>
          <li>the personal branding of creative content producers on YouTube (an empirical analysis of online profiles).</li>
          <li>iimpression management of social media 'makers' who control their social interactions through personal websites (an interview study).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We posit that the technical constraints of a system has an impact on user perceptions of the system, and the culture of the community which uses it. The <a href="#what-is-a-profile">final study</a> asks the question "what is a profile?" and takes an objective look at 18 online systems which employ user profiles in a social capacity to classify their features.</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Most people like to consider themselves to be quite honest in their communications with friends, family and acquaintances.  However, even honest people routinely modulate what they share, omitting and sometimes falsifying information in order to reduce social friction, avoid confrontation, defuse awkward situations, or to save face~\cite{buller1996interpersonal, burgoon1989maintaining}. Hancock et. al. introduced the term \emph{butler lies} to refer to a common use of simple lies to manage communications, such as smoothly exiting from an unwanted conversation~\cite{hancock2009butler}. Online, the notion of who our `friends' are has become increasingly blurred and difficult to define.  In such settings, people commonly navigate different social spaces, projecting and varying self-presentation according to the ways they want to be perceived by each~\cite{marwick2010TweetHonestly}. </p>

        <p>Whilst part of tailoring one's presentation to an audience is the ability to carry out some level of \emph{deception}, with personal communications, there is an implicit expectation of authenticity~\cite{aoki2005Ambiguity}. However, online, the need to navigate multiple and uncertain audiences means that we may constantly vary our self-presentation. Authenticity becomes a social construct derived from the social context and how we wish to be perceived by a given audience~\cite{boyd2002faceted}.  We may be deceiving, at least to some extent, nearly constantly without even being conscious of it.</p>

        <p>The use of deception as a technique for system designers has been discussed previously within the HCI community. For example, manipulation of users' mental models of systems in ways that benefit both systems' designers and end-users were documented by Adar et al.~\cite{adar2013Benevolent}. Ambiguity, often promoted through deception, gives people space for flexible interpretation~\cite{gaver2003Ambiguity}, and to tell stories they need to in order to preserve face and reputation~\cite{aoki2005Ambiguity, birnholtz2012distance}. However, the complexity of modern social software dictates that a growing cast of actors be considered, both human and computational, as targets, confederates, dupes and adversaries for any action.</p>

      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="liecloud-rqs" rel="schema:haspart">
      <h3>Context and research questions</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Here, we are interested in exploring the complex contexts in which deception might take place, to consider not just cases where the system lies to a user~\cite{adar2013Benevolent} or computer mediated communication where one user lies to others, but situations where systems lie to each other about users; where a user needs to lie to one audience but not another; where tools or systems might protect a person from disclosure to other systems or tools. As Nissenbaum puts it:</p>
        <blockquote>Those who imagined online actions to be shrouded in secrecy have been disabused of that notion. 
        \elide{As difficult as it has been to circumscribe a right to privacy in general, it is even more complex online because of shifting recipients, types of information, and constraints under which information flows.}
        We have come to understand that even when we interact with known, familiar parties, third parties may be lurking on the sidelines, engaged in business partnerships with our known parties. \cite{nissenbaum2004privacy}</blockquote>
        
        <p>The actors involved now include not just the people who are being immediately addressed, but others who are peripheral or incidental to the interaction as it occurs. Many systems include silent `lurkers', who observe without speaking. Others will discover and read conversations later, outside the contexts of their production. Beneath the visible surface of the communications tools people use, a growing series of invisible actors mine the interaction data which occur on their platforms, and others use the results of this mining. Many of these actors are computational systems of increasing power, sifting, sorting, re-purposing and inferring from the full spectrum of communicative data.</p>

        <p>Such practices began out-of-sight from most individuals, but have gradually gained visibility through large-scale data breaches and other events that have exposed the data harvesting practices of many kinds of service providers. The visibility of such events has led to increased interest in practical ways for individuals to better protect their personal information, and to re-gain control over how and when it is shared.  Brunton and Nissenbaum's recently published \emph{Obfuscation, a User's Guide}, for example, introduced a lexicon of deception to help ``the small players, the humble, the stuck, those not in a position to decline or opt out or exert control over our data emanations"~\cite{brunton2015obfuscation}, a description which fits a majority of users of online services today.  </p>

        <p>How might sophisticated privacy tools in the future facilitate greater end-user control of personal information through obfuscation and deception?  What might be the personal, moral, and ethical implications of the use of such tools online? In this paper, we explore these questions, and provide the following contributions:</p>

          <li>An expansion upon previous models of \emph{computer-mediated social deception} with new configurations, in which tools conduct or facilitate deception towards other people/systems/tools;</li>

      <h3>Study Design</h3>
      <div>
        <p>In this study, we explore the possibilities of tools that employ computer-mediated deception, and the potential for such tools to facilitate the maintenance of sustained, positive social relationships  in complex social environments.  We base our use of the term `deception' on McCornack's information manipulation theory ~\cite{mccornack1009InformationManipulation}, which encompasses both falsification and selective disclosure, such as for the purpose of creating ambiguity, or identity management.</p>

        <section id="liecloud-method" rel="schema:haspart">
          <h4>Method</h4>
          <div>
            <p>We sought to elicit diverse perspectives and experiences from people from a variety of backgrounds, around various deception configurations.  Drawing inspiration from critical design~\cite{bardzell2014reading}, we adopted a speculative design method in which we first generated a series of speculative design proposals~\cite{dunne2013speculative} consisting of realistic depictions of imagined, ``near future'' privacy tools.  These fictional privacy tools, with accompanying descriptions, which will henceforth be referred to as \emph{vignettes}, were then showed to participants in semi-structured interview settings .  </p>

            <p>Interviews were conducted in person and via video chat. At the start of interviews, participants were asked an opening question, ``How do you feel about your privacy online?'' which was used to gauge general attitudes and sensitivity towards privacy online. Then, two framing questions were asked during the interview for each vignette; the first was whether the individual would consider using a tool like the one described (and why/why not), and second, whether the ways they perceived others and information they saw online would change if they found out their friends were using a tool like the one described. Finally, participants were encouraged to share thoughts or personal experiences that they were reminded of by the vignette.</p>
            
            <p>Audio from sessions was recorded, transcribed and anonymised for identifiers of people, places and entities.  Inductive thematic analysis was carried out on the transcripts by analysing and coding them for themes, by three researchers independently.  Themes were then compiled, combined into a single pool, and discussed to derive a final coherent set of themes.  Related themes were then clustered into groups.  We organise our discussion of results according to these clusters.</p>

        <section id="liecloud-participants" rel="schema:haspart">
          <h4>Participants</h4>
          <div>
            <p>We recruited participants via Twitter, open Facebook groups, and word-of-mouth through personal connections. Those interested first answered demographic questions covering age, gender, employment status, frequency of use of social media, and self-perceptions of honesty. To ensure diversity in participants, fifteen (aged 18+) were selected in a way that maximised saturation on the attributes collected. </p>
            
          </div>
        </section>

        <section id="liecloud-designing-vignettes" rel="schema:haspart">
          <h4>Designing the vignettes</h4>
          <div>
            <p>We generated ideas for the vignettes along two main axes, and then used heuristics to select among candidates. The first axis was the degree to which machines mediated the deception; from tools that simply facilitated, otherwise manual acts of deception, to those that entirely automated it.  The second was inspired by Gaver's \emph{conceptual design proposals}, sought to explore the  ``balance between concreteness and openness: [...] specific enough to evoke intuitive reactions, yet indefinite enough to encourage imaginative extensions''~\cite{Gaver:2000:AEI:332040.332433}. With respect to heuristics, the first was realism; we wanted to aim for tools that would be realisable in the near future, inspired by Auger’s \emph{speculative designs}: ``speculative designs exist as projections of the lineage, developed using techniques that focus on contemporary public understanding and desires, extrapolated through imagined developments of an emerging technology''~\cite{auger2013speculative}. </p>

            <p>With these axes and guidelines, we generated two dozen candidate ideas, consulting with an expert on state-of-the-art privacy tools.  We then selected five that met the above criteria, were the most plausible, and that best covered the space spanned by design axes just described. To break ties, we preferred simpler vignettes to encourage participants to focus on implications rather than the tools themselves.  This process resulted in the following final five vignettes:</p>

            <p>\fig{SocialSteganography}{\emph{Social Steganography}: Diagram illustrating a social steganography tool for microblogging/SNS sites that hides ``real'' messages behind other, plausible status messages but allows certain people to recover the true meaning.}</p>
            <p>\fig{lieCal}{\emph{lieCal}: Fictional interface for a tool which automatically generates excuses on behalf of the user, optionally including friends in the deception and strengthening alibis by posting on social media. }</p>
            <p>\fig{lieCation}{\emph{lieTinerary}: Fictional tool to create a narrative of going somewhere (on holiday) or attending an event, along with images and social media posts to be sent out at preset times to corroborate the story.}</p>
            <p>\fig{lieMoves}{\emph{lieMoves}: A fictional smartphone service for letting people obfuscate their location using various strategies, including blurring, substitution, past-replay and impersonation. (Based on Figure \ref{fig:StructuresOfDeception}e,f.)}</p>
            <p>\fig{lieMapper}{\emph{lieMapper}: Fictional tool for predicting the flow of information (e.g. a lie) across a person's social network starting from a single friend.}</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Social Steganography (Figure \ref{fig:SocialSteganography})] inspired by danah boyd's studies of networked teens \cite{boyd2014s} that used in-group codes to discuss activities so that they were inscrutable to their parents. Here, the steganography is performed automatically: a trusted set of people see the `real' message, while everyone else sees an `innocent', socially plausible message (as in Figure \ref{fig:StructuresOfDeception}e, \ref{fig:StructuresOfDeception}g.).</li>
              <li>lieCal (Figure \ref{fig:lieCal})] can automatically or semi-automatically fill one's shared calendar with fictitious appointments based on past (and typical) daily schedules, to create ample opportunities for butler lies (Figure \ref{fig:StructuresOfDeception}e). Friends can be enlisted to give support to the lie, and additional corroborating evidence can be posted on social networks (Figure \ref{fig:StructuresOfDeception}h).</li>
              <li>lieTinerary (Figure \ref{fig:lieCation})] draws on Merel Brugman's \emph{Same Same But Different}, enables the pre-curation of a fictitious trip or fictional event attendance through pre-scheduled, coordinated posts across multiple social media platforms (Figure \ref{fig:StructuresOfDeception}e). </li>
              <li>lieMoves (Figure \ref{fig:lieMoves})] is a fictional service for mobile phones that replaces the user's actual location with data from user-selectable and customisable deception strategies: blurred (low-grain), superposition of locations, past replay, or ``typical'' herd-behaviour or individual simulation (Figure \ref{fig:StructuresOfDeception}b, \ref{fig:StructuresOfDeception}f).</li>
              <li>lieMapper (Figure \ref{fig:lieMapper})] shows the interconnectedness of communication channels. Extending Facebook's `this post will go to X people' functionality, it works across multiple networks to visualise all those within one's friend networks likely to hear about a particular piece of information.</li>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <div>
        <p>In the following sections, we first present detailed case studies of two participants (P8 and P9) to illustrate how individuals' attitudes towards privacy influenced their answers to some of the vignettes.  We follow these descriptions with a presentation of themes derived from all participants.</p>

        <section id="liecloud-results-participants" rel="schema:haspart">
          <h4>Participants</h4>
          <div>
            <p>Assuming they reported truthfully, the 15 participants we selected covered most of the major attributes in our demographic categories (see Figure \ref{fig:democrop}).
            One notable exception is that all participants identified as either male or female, and almost half of the participants were males aged 22--30. We did not collect information on race, sexuality or any other attributes which might be used to identify marginalised groups.</p>

            <p>11 participants self-reported using social networks several times a day, and all but one believed that half or less of their real world activity was represented on social media. 11 agreed or strongly agreed that they saw themselves as honest, but only seven agreed or strongly agreed to seeing themselves as honest online. Nearly half agreed that they thought their friends were honest. % interaction effects??</p>

            <p>Pertaining to attitudes towards privacy, 13 reported being at least \emph{somewhat} concerned about their privacy online. Based on our categorisation of participants according to responses to the opening question, slightly over half fell into the Westin category of \emph{privacy pragmatists}, while two fell into the category of \emph{privacy fundamentalists}, and the remaining four were \emph{unconcerned} about privacy. (High inter-rater agreement was achieved for this category; Fleiss's $k=0.624$ for 3 raters and $N=15$ participants.) These results show that in comparison to Westin's large survey of the American public~\cite{krane2002privacy}, which had a respective breakdown of 55\%-25\%-20\%, we had relatively few privacy fundamentalists among our participants, and slightly more of those in the unconcerned category.  However, a meta-survey of privacy indices show that our proportion is comparable to more recent results ~\cite{kumaraguru2005privacy}.</p>

          <h4>Case study: Privacy and people (P8)</h4>
          <div>
            <p>P8 is a former gradeschool teacher who has returned to university to get her Ph.D. She started using social media ten years ago when she was still working at the school, and her role as a teacher strongly shaped how she managed her exposure online. Specifically, her role influenced her caution in disclosing too much personally identifying information, but acknowledged that disclosure itself was important for fostering relationships and participation online.</p>
            
            <blockquote>When I was a teacher, I was very careful about what I said about teaching in school because at that point I'm not just `me', personally; I'm also `me' as a teacher, representing that school I was working at. Since I've stopped being a teacher, I unlocked my twitter feed, but still try not to post too much personal stuff online. But really, if you don't share some personal information then you miss out on so much interaction stuff, so it's a real balancing act.</blockquote>

            <p>She kept her Twitter feed primarily her professional colleagues, and her Facebook contacts her offline personal friends. She believed that, as a result, most of her interactions were with honest people, and tried to be as honest in her interactions online as possible, just as real life.  </p>

            <p>When discussing \emph{lieTinerary}, she described discovering that her ex-partner was fabricating extravagant holidays after their breakup in order to make her jealous.</p>

            <blockquote>[H]e wants me to think, ``Oh, I should have stuck with him - he's having a really good life!''. So there were pictures he was putting up [on Twitter] which were supposedly where he was on holiday, but of course once you know how to scrape people's Twitter data, you could see all of his posts were made in the UK.  And at that point it became really obvious that that's what he was doing, so that made me smile.%  But that's the only case [...] he's doing it purely because he likes to think I'm reading them, and of course I have had dipped in and have had a look and had a bit of a laugh about it.</blockquote>

            <p>She described wanting greater controls to be able to block said partner from getting around creating new profiles to look at her information:</p>

            <blockquote>I do know that, if he really wanted to he could easily set up another account.  So in the end, although he's blocked [on Twitter] I don't assume he can't see what I'm saying; I assume that he can, and that's another reason that I'm a bit careful with what I say.  So I wish it was easier, to stop people from being able to see what you're doing -- how that would happen I don't know -- but that would be really helpful.</blockquote>

          <h4>Case study: Honesty and self-image (P9)</h4>
          <div>
            <p>P9, a 22-year-old recent graduate, confessed he was very concerned about the availability of the data he gave out online due to a mistrust of companies.  Valuing honesty, however, he said he would feel guilty using tools that would cause other individuals to be deceived, especially if those tools left digital interaction traces that could serve as later reminders of such acts:</p>

            <blockquote>I feel like I'm told that I have a certain level of privacy, I don't quite ... know enough about comp sci or technology to properly have faith in that.  Like Facebook, Microsoft \ldots all tell me I'm safe online, and I might understand a bit of what they mean, but there isn't a great deal of explanation and I still think there are people out there who can get access to this stuff if they really wanted to.% So no..</blockquote>

            <p>With respect to how he manages his personal information, he prefers to be honest and transparent when the asking party is a person, even strangers online, but adopts a strategy of omission or falsification when the asking party is a company.</p>

            <blockquote>I'm quite an honest person, [...] like if I was on a forum and I was talking to someone I'd tell the truth. But if a company were to ask me for my number or my name -- I won't bother. </blockquote>
            <blockquote>I imagine [lieCal] would be useful because it would give me an excuse if I wanted to do something, but I would probably feel worse [\ldots] because it would serve as a reminder that I lied</blockquote>

            <p>However, he was confident there were others online that consider using tools like \emph{lieTinerary} to promote themselves and make themselves appear popular or cool, such as by pretending to go to exclusive events:</p>
            <blockquote>Well they might use [lieTinerary] to come across as fashionable or trendy --- they might put up a post like ``oh yeah I'm at London Fashion Week'' when they're not really [...] I could say I'm at Glastonbury for the weekend, and immediately my cool points would go up.</blockquote>
    
            <p>P9 believed that such fabrication was widespread already even without such tools, alongside acts of playing one's self up:</p>

            <blockquote>I know people who have paid for likes and followers and stuff and they hashtag everything to death because they're so desperate for attention [...] there are lots of people nowadays who just want quick success and they'll take all of these cheap, cheating routes.</blockquote>

          <h4>Case study: Privacy and technology (P13)</h4>
          <div>
            <p>P13 is a postgraduate student in his mid-twenties; technologically savvy and uses social networking sites every day. He is acutely aware of the volumes of data being collected through his web use, but finds himself weighing up the practicalities of taking steps to preserve his privacy with his immediate communication needs, often concluding that "life's too short" to act on his discomfort around third-party software.</p>
            <blockquote>I say what I'm doing on my Facebook because otherwise no-one will ever talk to me [...] I try and use small bits of privacy enhancing stuff, to whatever extent they actually work [...] So in the past I've had Facebooks where they're not tied to my... my lying even extended to that and all the information on them was fake. Nowadays I tend not to do that because the net effect of that is no-one talks to you.</blockquote>  
            <p>He takes steps to manage who sees his data on social media, by segregating his audience by platform, choosing who to share which aspects of his self with, and using privacy settings built into the platforms themselves. Sometimes this leads him to obtain information by proxy:</p>
            <blockquote>I don't connect to my mum's stuff and I don't want to connect to her stuff [...] but I wanted to find something out and so I remember asking my sister to look it up for me.</blockquote>

            <p>He is also resigned to data leakage, and being surveilled, by both the government and advertisers.</p>

            <blockquote>if it's online it's public to a certain degree right, it's... you can try and use all these controls to a certain extent, but they don't... there's always a way around things. It's like, when you're a kid and you're trying to listen to the radio and you're trying to store it cos you want to listen to whatever the thing is again. You know, theoretically they've got these measures that say oh no you can't copy this, but you stick a mic out into a cassette recorder and you've got the Hitchikers Guide, and hey. 
            I don't think I'm under any illusions about web stuff. If it's out there, it's out there. If someone wants to find it and knows the information or ways to get the information then they can get it. It's annoying, but it's a fact of life.
            </blockquote>

            <p>This does not stop P13 from providing false information to services whenever he has the opportunity, under the impression that the data many services ask for is superfluous. He speculated that tools could be useful to generate more believable false data on his behalf.</p>
            <blockquote>So for instance airport wifi. I spend a large amount of my time in airports. So I think I'm listed as John Smith or... 
            %definitely not in Bristol airport, I've got a different name and a different person when they're tracking whatever I'm doing in Edinburgh airport, different email address, different contact information, and yeah, so we start to lie about 
            [...] 
            So mostly it's whenever these anonymous websites want some personal information that they don't tend to have, then I tend to lie [...] But I always sort of wonder, should I be able to generate this?</blockquote>

            <p>In general, he was concerned about the social risks of using tools to aid online deception,``especially when you can do this social ways, just going, oh I forgot to use the Google calendar again,'' but was also skeptical about how much he could trust the tools themselves.</p>
            <blockquote>If [social steganography] was something that I could run on my computer and I'd have it disconnected from the network then maybe.</blockquote>

            <p>Despite his concerns, P13 expected that he would follow the status-quo if many people began using these tools, and expressly supported other people's right to use them, reasoning that the more people did so, the more effective they would become. However, he also anticipated that the output of the tools may be prone to detection and thus rendered useless.</p>

            <blockquote>You could imagine someone attacking these kinds of things and trying to start to write distinguishers for when is this posted by a human or is this posted by a social media bot. </blockquote>

        <section id="liecloud-effort" rel="schema:haspart">
          <h4>Effort and Complexity</h4>
          <div>
            <p>A common reason why participants wouldn't use these tools related to the amount of effort required to use them. P8 observed that the effort-of-use barrier is a challenge even for tools already available today, and postulated that platforms were exploiting the lack of adoption of these tools to their advantage:</p>

            <blockquote>The thing I've noticed is that people will always do the easiest [thing].  That's why nobody encrypts. I don't. You know, for all my concerns about privacy, I don't encrypt anything, [...] very few people take the extra security steps they can because it's convoluted. And the minute you ask people to do that, they'll just take the easiest route. Providers like Facebook and Twitter and all the apps out there know that, and that's why it's so easy for them to collect data - they know people will just take the easiest route. - P8</blockquote>

            <p>However, for some vignettes the extra effort was seen to pay off as an opportunity. For instance, in response to \emph{Social Steganography}, P6 contemplated that by broadcasting different status updates to distinct subsets of his friends on Facebook, he could control multiple identities simultaneously:</p>

            <p>I think essentially at this point you are projecting two identities simultaneously and you really would want to manage both. [...] it almost becomes twice the task. But the really interesting thing would be if different groups all had different keys - so you'd send a single status but they'd all see different ones. That would be sort of be neat, [to be] projecting multiple identities at once, because you can't really do that offline. Finally, technology would give us a chance to BETTER control our identities! - P6</p>

            <p>A second aspect that was mentioned was not the direct effort of use, but that indirectly required to stay on top of the wake of deception left by using such tools. In some settings, participants noted specific compensatory measures that would be required to prevent being found out, and noted the complexity and effort of these measures. </p>
            
            <p>If I used a tool like this and said I had been in meetings but then actually NOT logged the hours against the project, what the meeting was about or  anything like that, it would make my accounting for my own time very hard. - P7</p>

        <section id="liecloud-other-strategies" rel="schema:haspart">
          <h4>Availability of Other Channels, Strategies</h4>
          <div>
            <p>The most common reason given for not needing to use a tool was the availability of alternative approaches to achieving the desired objectives sought in which the fictional tools were imagined to be most useful. A common such strategy was simply \emph{omitting} or \emph{suppressing} information they did not wish to share; this strategy was used for a variety of privacy-related concerns as an alternative to use of the tools depicted in the \emph{Social Steganography} and \emph{lieMoves} vignettes.  A second common strategy was the use of \emph{other channels} and \emph{access control features}.  For instance, P13 discussed the use of encryption to both help control scope of a message and for unwanted leakage by platforms. Several mentioned Facebook and Google+'s built-in access control features for limiting the scope of a particular message as an alternative to using a steganography approach. </p>
            <p>In some cases, participants identified that alternate strategies were imperfect, and sometimes the fictional tool offered a better solution. For example, the alternate strategy of suppressing location leakage by turning location tracking off, was perceived as worse than \emph{lieMoves} by both P6 and P9, because doing so would cause apps that needed the user's location to simply refuse to work.</p>  

            <p>There were fewer alternative strategies given for the other vignettes; ``simply being honest'', and in particular ``blocking off time'' was given as a common strategy for situations where \emph{lieCal} would be useful (P4, P8, P9).  </p>

          <h4>Privacy and Control</h4>
          <div>
            <p>Several participants cited potential benefits to privacy control and management.  The leaking of location information was a concern; six participants reported keeping location services on their smartphones turned off by default for reasons such as to prevent apps from sending their location to third-parties without their consent.</p>  
            <blockquote>[lieMoves] would mostly catch out apps that were taking my location without even asking, because if I want to tell the truth when I think it matters, I can still do that, but those that are just spying on me gets crap! And that appeals, because they shouldn't be able to collect in the first place! - P6</blockquote>

            <p>P8 asked whether \emph{lieMoves} was available for use, because she wanted it immediately to keep Google from tracking her.</p>
            <p>I want to install it immediately and keep using it for the rest of my life! I wouldn't have any ethical worries about it because I wouldn't be lying to anyone, I would be lying to Google, and that's exactly what I want to do!  Because they shouldn't have this information in the  first place, so giving them wrong information is perfect. As I said, can I have this today, please? - P8</p>

            <p>Others pointed out that a remaining impediment to adoption of such tools is still a remaining lack of awareness of how services operated and used people's information.</p>

            <blockquote>People can't make value judgements about the systems they interact with because they don't understand them well enough yet, especially what's going on behind the scenes. They don't actually feel the need to deceive system and platforms because they don't even know they're being spied upon. - P6</blockquote>

          <h4>Authenticity and Crafting Personas</h4>
          <div>
            <p>Participants reflected on how the data they shared affected other people's perceptions of them, as well as their perceptions of others on social media. P11 (in agreement with P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, P8, P9, P12 and P15) assumed that her friends engaged in ``image-shaping'' by ``being quite selective or trying to present a particular kind of persona'', and described an occasion when a contact's online presentation was at odds with what she knew to be happening offline.</p>

            <blockquote>People will always seem like they're having a really good time and post about how great everything is but then you talk to them and things aren't actually quite how they're made to be portrayed on social media. [...] So like one of my friends, her sister was just posting about her one year anniversary of getting married, and how brilliant it was, and they were both posting about the presents they got for each other. Within a month they were separated [...] I know more about that from talking to my friend personally, but in terms of what's presented online to a different audience, to a much wider audience, that was not what was going on. - p11</blockquote>

            <p>P12 described a friend who, unable to withhold information or resist questions from an inquisitive audience, made up stories about her life to satisfy them, thus creating a persona.</p>
            <blockquote>'Cos of the following that some fanfiction gets, she gets asked a lot of personal questions and she doesn't want to feel rude so she just lies, so she answers these very personal questions so she feels connected to her audience but she deliberately lies 'cos she finds it sometimes a bit invasive. - P12</blockquote>
            
            <p>P8 and P15 similarly mentioned deception used to protect privacy without alienating people. In contrast, others saw total openness in their sharing as important for presenting their "authentic" selves on social media, and thought less of those who they perceived to be engaged in deliberate image-shaping.</p>

            <blockquote>I wouldn't be friends with people who would be lying all the time or who make up stuff just for attention. [...] if I found out that there was someone I was interested in doing this the faith I put in them or the fact that I was being very genuine would take a hit. - P9</blockquote>

            <p>Though sometimes in conflict with attempts at authenticity, a number of respondents echoed the sentiment that degrees of deception are crucial for maintaining a well-functioning society.</p>

            <blockquote>I think that not telling people -- everyone, everything -- is a central aspect of being kind in the world. - P15</blockquote>

            <blockquote>It's about empowerment -- little lies, like ``I'm just too tired and you're quite a taxing person'' could be the truth but that's a bit mean, and you didn't want to say that! versus ``oh no sorry I have plans with my boyfriend'' which might be a lie, but it's nice. - P6</blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>Often you lie to save people's feelings or -- to stop someone finding out about a surprise party. Like there are really nice reasons to lie, and if you could help people make nice lies safer, that would be awesome! - P14</blockquote>
 
            <p>P6 commented that this could be a subtle method of signalling violations of personal privacy online:</p>
            <blockquote>The idea of being able to put massively sarcastic calendar appointments just so that, when someone looks at my calendar to see what I'm doing, they know I don't want them to know, and they should just stop asking.  - P6</blockquote>

            <p>Such methods were also viewed as a form of social empowerment; a way of giving people freedom to block off time (\emph{lieCalendar}) or send a message (\emph{Social Steganography}) in situations where the honest approach would be awkward due to shyness, introversion, or differences in social positions, e.g. having to contradict a superior or respected senior.</p>

            <blockquote>Somebody younger, less experienced, less confident might find that this is a nice, straightforward way of blocking time out for themselves and feeling good or comfortable about it.  Because it can be quite difficult saying ``no, I'm not free'' to someone senior. - P8</blockquote>

          <h4>Access control and imagined audience</h4>
          <div>
            <p>Many participants discussed their expectations of who could access their social data and messages.  P15 and P11 mentioned assuming private Facebook messages could be read only the recipient; all but four participants segregated their friends using platform privacy settings.</p>

            <blockquote>If I wanted only certain people to know something I'd just send them a private message rather than put it as my status anyway. - P11</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Very occasionally I will post things only on Facebook and not Twitter because then only my friends can see it. - P6</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Why would I need such a tool when I can define on Facebook, for every single message exactly who sees it? - P7</blockquote>

            <p>Contrarily, several participants also rationalised that they must assume that anything they post online could be made completely public at any moment, and the safest technique is not to share at all. </p>

            <blockquote>If there's something you don't want people to know, then you just  don't tell. - P7</blockquote>

            <p>P12, meanwhile, said \emph{lieMapper} would potentially improve her ability to maintain separation among her separate personas online by showing her when information from multiple identities linked up.</p>

            <blockquote>This one is more just a way for you to control your privacy [...] Cos I don't actually have anything linked directly [between identities], but probably they have certain things links other ways, so that would be quite interesting to see. - P12</blockquote>
            
            <p>P2 and P14 were among those who considered themselves not interesting enough for anyone to want to invade their privacy, and P4 even found it "felt quite good" when he found his private facebook profile had been accessed by someone outside of their network because he "was of interest to someone".</p>

            <p>Finally, many of the participants volunteered their views on ethical or moral reasons of why they would or would not use these tools in specific ways. Perspectives varied in general and according to the vignette presented.</p>

            <p>The technology vignettes could be seen as ethically neutral, with the ethics coming from the manner of their use:</p>
            <blockquote>If your intention is to use these tools to harm someone, then that's the individual's own decision to make and you can decide for yourself whether that's morally right or wrong.  But simply using the tools themselves doesn't imply you're going to do something that is harmful or morally wrong. - P5</blockquote>

            <p>However, in some cases, there was such a strong implication between the design of the tool and the kinds of lies which it facilitates that the morality of the tool became the morality of the action:</p>

            <blockquote>Well as someone who's considered murdering people before, this is exactly how I would do it. I would create a fake social media presence so I could go off and do something illegal or even \ldots I could commit adultery, I really can't see much of a practical application for ethically good things\ldots} - p14, discussing lieTinerary</blockquote>

            <p>To P6, whether deception was moral contextually dependant on whether the recipient had a legitimate need for the truth and why.  </p>

            <blockquote>If someone has a right to know something for some reason [...] then lying to them there is more problematic than if they didn't have a right to ask you, or to be looking for that information. [...]  that's their own fault; they should have know they shouldn't have looked. - P6</blockquote>

            <p>Some participants suggested that they would need a really good reason to use deception tools. P14 felt that a better alternative to having to lie was to get out of situations in which one felt the need to lie.</p>

            <blockquote>And if you're in a situation where you have to lie to people about where you are, then that's a situation you need to get out of cos that's a creepy situation [...] The only time I can see this being good is like if you're in an abusive marriage and you're going to a divorce lawyer in secret. - P14</blockquote>

            <p>There was often a moral distinction made between friends and platforms as the targets of deception. While a majority (11) reported taking issue with deliberately deceiving friends, there was also widespread consensus on wanting not to deceive a general audience on social media. A notable exception to this was a feeling that lying to platforms is not dishonest.</p>

            <blockquote>well if I'm talking to my friend I always tell the truth; I'm quite an honest person ... but I don't think lying to Facebook is unethical [\ldots], because it's not affecting any of your friends or anyone on your list, so it has no effect -- so you're not really lying to anyone? [...] I don't trust these companies enough, to be honest, with the information I supply them. - P9</blockquote>

            <p>P6 took the position that lying to platforms should be the moral choice, even part of one's civic duty.</p>

            <blockquote>I think lying to Facebook is to be encouraged! [platforms] spend so much effort in deceiving users into thinking they're doing one thing when they're doing another, that giving users some control seems fine. Its sort of like the debate whether minorities can be racist against white people -- like, whether the power imbalance seems to negate any meaningful argument, certainly when it comes to lying to services. - P6</blockquote>

          <h4>Morality of Deception</h4>
          <div>
            <p>Our participants, like the majority of people, like to think of themselves as being generally honest, but this has a nuanced relationship with their stated behaviour.  There was a common feeling that deceiving platforms and corporations was acceptable, or even a moral imperative. Nomenclature was significant: casting activities as `lying' provoked responses which paid more attention to the ramifications of being found out, and a greater sense of ethical violation. Hiding information was generally seen as acceptable, as was partitioning information for different audiences, especially in the context of avoiding unwanted attention. Politeness was often cited as a valid reason for performing white lies, a variety of kindness. </p>

            <p>Akerlof and Schiller's account~\cite{schiller2015Phishing} focuses on deception from the point of view of corporations, and therefore helps explain the existence of situations in which our participants were motivated to deceive. In the information economy, data subjects are beguiled, misled or strongarmed into giving away more data than is required for the service they wish to access. However, perhaps because their focus is wider than the information economy, Akerlof and Schiller fail to consider the possibility of the individual creating counter-asymmetries by manipulating the data they provide to corporations. Their recommended counter-measures are all intended to support truthfulness - standards-setting, reputation, regulation. Yet these all require concerted action; deception is a strategy open to the individual.</p>

        <section id="liecloud-social-honesty" rel="schema:haspart">
          <h4>Promoting Social Honesty</h4>
          <div>
            <p>One viewpoint is that mendacious impulses are indicative of a problematic situation: that fixing the socio-technical context would remove the need to deceive, and the community could become more socially honest. Systems requesting excessive information frequently provoked anger, and a feeling that feeding back fictitious information was justified. One lens for designers to engage with this issue is Grice's conversational maxims. Typically, these are used to define one side of a social contract: the quantity, quality, relation and manner of information production. </p>

            <p>A complimentary view applies them to requests for information. This accounts for many of the indignant quotes we recieved---systems were asking for \emph{too much} information, or \emph{irrelevant} information. Providing clarity here, relating information demands to the current context, limiting information to the that which is necessary can guide designers towards upholding the platform's end of the social contract. Our \emph{lieMapper} vignette asked how far through our social networks personal information was likely to diffuse, alerting the user to social information  violations; similarly, when designers illuminate the hidden pathways which our data takes---or doesn't---it provides a grounding on which trust can be built.</p>

            <p>Legal identities, and the problems which they cause, highlight the multifacted aspects of life, whether online or off. The general trend is towards a collapse of context, the joining of identities across sites and networks, but the attitude that people should be happy to connect all of their identities together in this way is an expression of social privilege. Tools exist to aid the management of multiple personas, typically used by astroturfing organisations~\cite{kolivos2012consumer, gilewicz2012digital}. As a provocation, what would design for multifaceted life look like? Are there ways to support participants in plural presentation, helping them to understand and maintain their context bounds, rather than attempting to force a homogenisation. How can we support radical self expression and support marginalised groups? What about systems which acknowledge that there are parts of users lives which they don't want to share publicly, but they still need to express them and connect with similar people? Designing for contextual authenticity rather than imposing singular identity pushes back against marginalisation.</p>

          <h4>Memory, safety, and plausible deniability</h4>
          <div>
            <p>It was clear from responses that being reminded of one's lies can be upsetting, especially for people who consider themselves honest. On one hand, this might suggest systems might automatically remove, or reduce the visibility of, digital traces that could serve as reminders of one's past deceit.  The recent growth in messaging apps that automatically delete messages after a single viewing~\cite{messaging2015} might, in fact, be related to this perceived design need. On the other hand, visibility of such actions can lead people towards greater honesty---knowing how often one was deceptive could clearly be a powerful push towards veracity.</p> 

            <p>A second major theme addressed the effort, both of using the tool, and dealing with its potential consequences.  It was clear that any tool that required more time and effort than customary was perceived as too burdensome.  There was also the consideration of the side-effects caused by such tools, and the degree of effort required to ensure such repercussions would not cause deceptions to be discovered.  But having to explicitly act at all was also viewed negatively; that is, having to engage with a tool in order to carry out a deception, such as with \emph{lieCal}, was viewed less favourably than something that could do it automatically, such as \emph{lieMoves}. </p>

            <p>An additional problem with requiring explicit action is that doing so often leaves little space for plausible deniability.  When explicit action is needed, it becomes often difficult to justify that such an action was taken accidentally or unintentionally (assuming the individual is of sound mind).  If we instead imagine tools that \emph{deceive by default}, the possibility that a deception was simply a side effect of being busy or forgetting to make the system tell the truth would remain.  For example, a deceive-by-default variation of \emph{lieCal} might automatically fill the person's calendar with false but plausible appointments, allowing its user to quickly identify and replace them with real ones as needed. Such designs would additionally support many of the goals of \emph{privacy-by-design}~\cite{schaar2010privacy}.</p>

            <p>Another significant barrier to the use of such tools is related to safety and discovery, the first ensuring that deceptive actions would not have unintended consequences, while the second pertains to the effort and actions necessary to ensure deceptions would not be discovered.  Such concerns suggest that there is a potential space for future tools that are able to support \emph{safe deception}, both in terms of highlighting potential hazards, and towards mitigating the burden of covering up active lies and their effects.  Tools such as \emph{lieMapper} that are able to provide situational awareness about social information flow could help individuals tell certain, especially \emph{nice lies} (as described by P8), safely.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Deception is a long-established strategy for informational self-determination, and it is not a surprise to see the practice in online behaviour. The study reported here is a necessary prolegomenon to the deep study of deception, and establishes interesting lines of enquiry which mark out a descriptive vocabulary, a potential design space, and even the beginnings of a sketch of a bottom up morality in this area. Nissenbaum outlined the importance of contextual integrity for online design, the idea that individuals bring a set of expectations and meanings to their online interactions that are often derived from offline analogues, appropriately or otherwise. A designed interaction that leaves no space for someone to present themselves creatively for non-malevolent purposes fails to preserve contextual integrity, and would consequently produce an asymmetry of understanding between user and system of which the user may be unaware.</p>

        <p>Deception is often an expensive strategy, involving some creativity, the avoidance of passivity and the maintenance of consistency in an alternative model. In all but its simplest forms, it is not something that most people do lightly. Particular strategies and opportunities for deception were common to many of our subjects, who were often concerned with the balance between the moral injunction against lying, and their own interests. Mitigating factors were sought - for example, if the interlocutor in the interaction is non-human (a platform, for instance), or if the interaction provided an opportunity for malign activities (e.g. could be used by a stalker), or if the interlocutor did not have a good reason for wanting the data, then these were seen as justifications for using deception for protection. Morally, there are of course issues with this -- in particular, whether deceivers are free-riding on the efforts of a truthful majority. Deception is a successful strategy for self-protection, but presumably the deceiver also wants the benefits of the interaction, which may not be forthcoming if interactions with other agents also produced false data. However, the moral calculations of our subjects compared their own interests with the legitimacy of the interests of whoever demanded the data.</p>

        <p>Despite the preliminary nature of our study, the results suggest many questions for consideration by system designers. Those providing services for data need to identify, respect and avoid the factors which lead users to deception. The act of deception creates a situation in which data minimisation is in the interests of the platform -- the less that it asks for, the more likely it is to be trusted, and the less likely the deception strategy is to be invoked. In particular, contextual integrity is preserved if users are able to represent themselves differently in different contexts, and it is clear to them that the more data that is demanded, the easier it is to resolve these personas. Similarly, there is a set of deceptions, such as butler lies, which are adapted to specific communication situations, and facilitating these will also help transfer and preserve expectations in the digital context.</p>

        <p>Systems which facilitate deception will have both positive and negative potential. Most obviously, their wide uptake would reduce trust in data generally. On the other hand, it is clear from our study that for most people, deception is a last resort, that is, the majority self-image is one of general honesty so that deception would demand ad hoc justification. A rather more calculated invocation of a deception system might, if such attitudes were widespread, be a step too far. Framing the objective of the system will be key -- for example, classifying such systems as privacy-enhancing, rather than deceiving, might increase their acceptance. However, software that maintains a consistent, false record of events might remove the burden of understanding for users that their behaviour is deceptive, thus making it easier to deceive. Such divergent potential outcomes require investigation.</p>

  <h2>Constructing online identity</h2>
  <div>
    <p>This section has been adapted from work published as <em>Constructed Identity and Social Machines: A Case Study in Creative Media Production</em> (2014, Proceedings of WWW, Seoul).</p>
    
    <section id="constructing-intro" rel="schema:haspart">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <div>
        <p>In {part x} we described existing work in understanding socio-technical systems as Social Machines, and argue that due to the complex nature of online identity, understanding nuanced identity behaviours of Social Machine participants in a more granular way is crucial. Here, we briefly describe <em>creative media production social machines</em>, and present the results of a study of personas portrayed by participants in one of these. We then describe additional dimensions along which a Social Machine can be classified in order to better understand human participants as individuals.</p>

        <p>Amongst the plethora of user-generated content on the web are a huge number of works of creative media, and behind these are independent content creators pushing their work to a global audience and actively seeking to further their reach. Within this ecosystem we can see <em>creative media production social machines</em> on a variety of different scales. The definition of creative media production social machines encompasses a broad class of systems where:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>humans may use a purely digital, or combination of digital and analogue methods, and a degree of creative effort, to produce media content;</li>
          <li>the content is published such that it is publicly accessible on the web;</li>
          <li>a global audience may consume, curate and commentate on this content in technologically-mediated environments.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These social machines exist both within and across content host platforms (eg. YouTube) and within and across online communities and social networks. Many, if not all, media types and genres are represented among the media artefacts that emerge from these systems, and the content combines with its reception to have a sometimes profound effect on media and culture in the offline world.</p>

        <p>Figure \ref{vlog} shows the interconnected social and technical systems engaged when a simple vlog (video blog) is uploaded to YouTube. These processes would be further expanded if the creator was to branch out and produce different types of content, collaborate with another creator, cross-publicise, share audiences or even co-own a YouTube channel or other website profile.</p>

        <p><img src="figs/fig_vlog.eps" alt="Interconnected social and technical systems necessary for publishing a vlog on YouTube.\label{vlog}" /></p>

        <p>Creative media production social machines create an environment in which content creators of all backgrounds and abilities are able to publish outside of the constraints of traditional media channels. These creators are actively vying for attention from the masses; competing for views, likes and shares on a global scale. How they present themselves to their audience can be critical to their success, but also a ground for playful experimentation.</p>

        <p><strong>Motivations for participation</strong></p>

        <p>It is worth noting that there are a variety of motivations or incentives for content creators to participate in these systems.</p>

        <p>Some content host sites provide direct financial incentive for popularity (eg. YouTube's Google Adsense). Others facilitate a commission based model, where creators show off their work and take paid requests for custom pieces from the community (eg. DeviantArt). For content creators who publish primarily on such systems, their activity on other systems is usually tied to driving traffic back to the content which makes them money, or entertaining the fanbase from whom they thrive (eg. a creator who publishes sketch comedy on YouTube might use their Twitter account to tell original jokes to maintain interest in between video releases).</p>

        <p>But for many content creators, the financial rewards from their chosen content host sites might be a convenient side-effect of doing something that they love. Reputation as a creator of high quality content, a talented artist or a particularly funny comedian might be their primary driver. There are also social cues in many communities that affect content creator behaviour. Sometimes creators don't want to be accused of 'pandering' to their audience or losing their artistic integrity, and regulate their behaviour accordingly.</p>

        <p>The visibility of quantitative data collected by a content host site – such as how many views a piece of content has, how often they are referred to as a co-creator, or how often a content creator persona responds to viewer comments – may also impact behaviour. Technical factors are often highly conflated with the social norms in a community.</p>

        <p>Thus, the core reasons for creating content can affect both the content created and how creators present themselves to their audience in the process.</p>

    <section id="context-and-research-questions" rel="schema:haspart">
      <h3>Context and research questions</h3>
      <div>
        <p>The nature of identity and anonymity in online spaces is well discussed \cite{Donath2002, Halpin2006, Rains2007, Ren2012}. Humans naturally adjust the way they present themselves according to the context, and different online spaces may afford different levels of flexibility in doing this. Some systems don't require any kind of registration to post content, allowing people to adopt and discard personas as needed, and to create social cues to identify each other that are not designed as part of the system \cite{Bernstein2011}. Entirely different behaviour occurs in systems that strongly encourage or even try to enforce usage of real names. Often it is trivial for people to create multiple accounts under different pseudonyms anyway, but there may be an increased expectation of honesty from other users of the system, which itself affects the culture of communities within.</p>

        <p>In many cases the fact that people present themselves differently in different contexts is unconscious; a side effect of their participation in a particular system according to the social norms or technical affordances (eg.\ their desired username may be unavailable resulting in the forging of new branding around an alternative). In other cases, the creation of alternative personas is engineered and deliberate, either from the outset or as something that has evolved over time. But, beyond carefully crafting a single identity each, multiple individuals may participate in the portrayal of a single persona \cite{Dalton2013} and one individual may present versions of themselves through <em>multiple</em> personas.</p>
        
        <p>The public profiles of content creators were examined with the following questions in mind:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>How do content creators present themselves within and across communities?</li>
          <li>To what extent are content creators' online presences consistent platforms, and how is their content distributed across different online presences?</li>
          <li>How, and to what extent, do content creators present connections between their own online presences?</li>
        </ol> 
        <p>We also take note of their audience, the type of content they create, and the capabilities of the platforms on which they publish their content, to add context.</p>

            <p>Ten content creators were selected from a subset of creators with whose content we have a passing familiarity through encountering it online over the past months to years. This resulted in a broad spectrum of content types (video, animation, music, art, written word) genres (comedy, game commentaries, educational, political), popularity, well-knownness and activity levels. We deliberately examined content creator profiles from the perspective of a content consumer, or casual audience member.

            <p><strong>Table: Distribution of profiles for content creators in the study.</strong></p>

            <p>'Second channels' are common on YouTube. Creators who focus on one type of content (eg.\ sketch comedy) publish this on their main channel as well as using their main channel identity for interactions on the site. On their second channel they publish content that they may consider to be of interest to only a part of their main audience, such as vlogs about their lives, outtakes from main channel content, or experimental pieces. Most content creators with second channels post explicit links to them on their main channel, and often publicise them within content metadata or as part of the content directly. In some cases, including those where the connection between two channels is explicit and obvious, the creators behave differently towards their audience through second channel content. This varies greatly depending on the type of content produced. In some cases, second channels may be perceived as more reflective of the creator's 'true' personality, if they project themselves as more serious or honest, and publish more personal content like vlogs or behind-the-scenes footage. Whether or not this is accurate is impossible to know without intimate knowledge of the creators' offline life of course. The significance is that persona variations exist, and creators do not necessarily hide these alternative presentations of themselves from their audience.</p>

            <p>Additionally, there are profiles which are <em>not</em> directly linked from the (self-identified) 'main' profile, or the links are treated as though to the profile of a different person. Figure \ref{clinks} shows three screenshots of different YouTube channels showing different ways creators link out to other versions of themselves.</p>

            <p><img src="fig_channellinks.eps" alt="Dane transparently links to 3 of his channels, two for alternative content types and one for a character he created.  2. Fred is a character played by Lucas, but the links on Fred's channel treat Lucas as a different person. 3. Andrew Lemming lists Khyan as &quot;Uncle&quot;, although Khyan is the creator of the Andrew Lemming character. \label{clinks}" /></p>

            <p>Creators also used their profiles to link to shared channels (where either multiple creators post content independently of each other, or creators collaborate to produce joint content, or a both), and channels of others with whom they regularly work.</p>

            <p>Most profile host sites offer limited options for customisation, and the use of consistent branding was intermittent. This mostly took the form of identical or similarly styled display pictures, similarly phrased introductory paragraphs, and similarly styled content.</p>

            <p>Some creators have profiles which are distinctly grouped into alternative personas. This was evident from the branding, content and connections between them.</p>

          <div>
            <!-- Todo: dig up actual results with connection counts and add them here -->

            <p>How connections to other people were represented varied depending on the technical system. We can differentiate between mutual relationships between accounts (eg. 'friend') and one-directional relationships (eg. 'follower', 'subscriber'). Some systems offer both types of relationship, some one or the other. For YouTube channels, popularity ranged from over 3.5 million subscribers for Dane's character channel <em>realannoyingorange</em> to 118 for Bown's secondary <em>bowntalks</em> channel.</p>

            <p>The importance of these connections varies depending on the system as well as on the attitude of the system user. Mutual connections may initially be presumed to indicate a closer relationship, but this is not always the case. Some systems allow users to accept all friend requests en masse, which they may do to please fans, resulting in a lot of essentially meaningless mutual connections. Instead, outbound one-directional connections come in far smaller numbers, and indicate the content creator is particularly interested in the outputs of the other creators they choose to follow. It is normal for content creators to follow other creators with whom they have collaborated.</p>

            <p>Although their use is to some degree shaped by community norms, such connections are strongly influenced by the architecture of the particular website. However in addition, most of the websites examined allow enough control over the textual content of a profile that profile owners can manually create links to other documents on the web. Creators may also be able to adapt the content publishing interfaces to add additional connections (eg. adding links to Twitter and Facebook accounts in the description of a YouTube video), and often do. These connections necessitate extra effort on the part of the content creator, and tell us more about their relationships with other online accounts. Figure \ref{connections} shows different types of connections between profiles and personas for one content creator.</p>

            <p><img src="fig_fred.eps" alt="Lucas Cruickshank was an early YouTube success story through his persona Fred Figglehorn. Here, different types of connections between various online accounts belonging to both Lucas and Fred are illustrated. \label{connections}" /></p>

            <p>Content creators at all levels of activity do not have straightforward relationships with the systems they use for publishing and publicising their content. Through manually examining profiles, it is possible to identify personas, and connections between creators, and understand the likely explanations behind them. Currently there is no way to formalise these deductions. Methods for formalisation are useful for gaining a deeper understanding of the actions in this space, as well as for creating machine-readable representations of social machine participants.</p>

    <section id="framework-for-understanding-identities-of-social-machine-participants" rel="schema:haspart">

      <h3>Framework for understanding identities of social machine participants</h3>
      <div>

        <p>Based on the findings previously described, we propose four closely linked but distinct concepts that are useful in a granular discussion of identities of social machine participants: roles, attribution, accountability and traceability.  We explain each in the context of creative media production social machines, and show how they can be used as dimensions to assess the nature of individual identity in a social machine.</p>

        <p><strong>Roles</strong></p>

        <p>A creative media production social machine contains consumers, commentators and curators, and creators \cite{Luther2007a}. These roles are interchangeable, and content creators may wish to adopt different personas according to the role they are playing. Plus, content creators are often multi-talented and they may wish to put on a different face according to the different types of content they publish. How easily this is accomplished, according to the social expectations and technical affordances of a system that is part of a social machine, can impact the behaviour of participants.</p>

        <p><strong>Attribution</strong></p>

        <p>In content creation communities, contributions to media output are directly connected to building reputation, so content creators generally desire to have their name attached to work they produce. If the publication system does not allow this directly, as is often the case for sites that host collaborative works (a video published on one YouTube channel may contain contributions from several creators, each with their own channels), then creators adapt the system as best they can (the uploader may list links to the channels of all contributors in the video description) \cite{Luther2010}. Even when a content host site provides automatic linking to other user profiles – common in remixing communities – this isn't necessarily enough. \cite{Monroy-Hernandez2011} finds that human-given credit means more, and so free-text fields for content metadata are often used anyway.</p>

        <p><strong>Accountability</strong></p>

        <p>In many of the oft-discussed social machines, like Wikipedia, Galaxy Zoo, Ushahidi, and the theoretical crime data social machine in \cite{ByrneEvans2013}, accurate data is critical to the usefulness of the output of the system(s). Thus, accountability through identity is important. It is reasonable then to want to regulate participants somehow. But this cannot be universally applicable.</p>

        <p>The production of creative content is a domain that exemplifies the need for taking a more flexible approach to identity understanding and management. On one hand, creators wish to be accurately credited for their work and plagiarism may even result in a financial or reputational loss. On the other hand, creators may appear under multiple guises, engage in diverse behaviours and make contradictory statements about their participation in a creative work, all in the name of entertainment. Creators may also engage in some activities under an alternative identity in order to avoid any effect on the reputation of their main persona. These are valid uses of the anonymity provided by online spaces – a core feature of the World Wide Web – and should be allowed. Such activities won't necessarily even result in diminished trust. A content consumer may fully enjoy a series of vlogs, unaware that the vlogger is a character and the life events portrayed are entirely fictional, and be none the worse off for it.</p>

        <p><strong>Traceability</strong></p>

        <p>We consider traceability in terms of the settings in which an individual might interact with others. A person participating in a creative media production social machine may exist behind a different persona when participating in a scientific discovery social machine, and yet another in a health and well-being social machine. The discovery that other participants in the health and well-being social machine are aware of their alternate persona in the creative media production social machine may cause them to amend one or both of their personas. If the risk of their multiple identities being 'discovered' is high they may adjust their behaviour accordingly, whether this is ceasing all attempts at 'deception', or taking steps to decrease the overlap of the communities of which they are a part.</p>

        <p>Further to this, well known content creators often appear at offline events to meet their fans. Those who star in popular video content are recognised in the street. They are interviewed by journalists and contracted to produce viral adverts by marketing companies. Only with careful control of their online persona can they successfully engage in offline interactions like this. A content creator who appears in poorly-produced videos as an apparently genuine violent drunk and who sends abusive messages to other website users along the same theme to maintain the persona, may not be considered a candidate for a job in broadcast media. Even if in actuality, they have skilfully written and portrayed a believable character.</p>

        <p>An example in which the traceability of personas was crucial is the DARPA Network Challenge \cite{Tang2011}, for which participants needed to provide their 'real life' identities to win the cash prizes. Even if they had operated under pseudonyms during the competition, in order to validate their claims they needed to make known these personas and consolidate them with an identity that would allow them to receive the prize money.</p>

        <p>Knowledge of others present the online and offline spaces in which someone spends time may influence how they establish their personas in these spaces. An evolution of these spaces or a change in the individual's circumstances over time may cause them to revise their personas.</p>

          <div>

            <p>We can apply these concepts to social machines in order to understand the importance of individuals' identities within them. We use some well known social machines as examples for each dimension.</p>

            <p>The <em>roles</em> dimension describes the ease at which participants can change the role they play in a system.</p>

            <p>The <em>attribution</em> dimension allows us to consider whether or not crediting participant contributions is important.</p>

            <p>The <em>accountability</em> dimension helps us to decide whether the provenance of the inputs make a difference. In a Social Machine where this is critical, regulating identities to ensure trustworthy data would make sense.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <div>

        <p>We have demonstrated through an empirical study that participants in social machines often have complex relationships with their own self-representation, and with their connections to others in a system. Individuals may have one-to-many or many-to-one relationships with online personas, for a number of different reasons, and with different levels of transparency. We have presented a preliminary framework which allows the degree to which this complexity can affect the overall understanding of a social machine to be assessed along four dimensions: roles, attribution, accountability and traceability.</p>

        <p>All four of these dimensions can be understood to relate to the amount of <em>control</em> a user has over their identity within a system. The role(s) taken on by an individual can be affected by the extent to which an one is able to create and discard identities. Whether participants can be attributed or held accountable for their contributions, and the extent to which one identity can be traced to another, are affected by whether identities are persistent, and whether anonymous contributions are accepted. </p>

        <p>Roles arise through, and may be enforced by, either the technical affordances of a system, or the social expectations of a community (or both). The role(s) an individual chooses to take on may also be affected by their personal motivations, desires or needs. Thus roles are also influenced by the <em>context</em> in which a system is being used.</p>

        <p>Attribution and traceability both relate to the <em>connectivity</em> of a system. Participants may see each others' contributions, and may build reputation accordingly and present a particular impression to their audience. This reputation and impression can translate to other technically disconnected systems if identities are transparently linked.</p>

        <p>Traceability of identities, whether intended or not, can <em>cascade</em> across the Web and feed into a broader network of data about an individual, which may have unforeseen consequences in the future.</p>

  <h2>Social Media Makers</h2>
  <div>

    <section id="smm-intro" rel="schema:haspart">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <div>

        <p>The Web today is a very different place than the one imagined by its creator, Tim Berners-Lee~\cite{weavingtheweb}.  Instead of a vast network of individuals running their own web servers to host homepages or share information, most people simply navigate to Twitter to tweet, log in to Facebook to post a status update, use Wordpress.com to write up their thoughts. With a daily active user poulation of over 1.13 billion\footnote{https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2016/Facebook-Reports-Second-Quarter-2016-Results/default.aspx}, Facebook alone constitutes a full quarter of all Web traffic\footnote{http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/04/facebook-is-eating-the-internet/391766/}. </p>

        <p>However, there are individuals who in certain ways reject the massive social platforms that have swallowed the Web. Instead, they embrace 'home-grown' approaches to building their own web presences, much like the 'old days of the Web. But unlike the old days, when such a presence might have comprised a homepage, such 'DIY Web' hackers now piece together their own bespoke social and data management platforms, akin to the kinds of services offered by social platforms, for managing their interactions and identities online. Often, such capabilities are realised by using an ensemble of open source tools supported by developers with like interests. However, the various motivations for these individuals, and the perspectives they have gained from doing so have, thus far, not been studied extensively.</p>

      <h3>Context and research questions</h3>
      <div> rel="schema:haspart"
        <p>In the previous section we examined how individuals who participate in massive, centralised online communities present themselves and manage their interactions with an audience. In this section, we present a study which seeks to understand what drives individuals who <em>avoid</em> mainstream social platforms to find other ways to present themselves online, as well as a descriptive characterisation of their digital spaces. We targeted a broad class of self-described <em>digital makers</em>: those who identify with taking a hands-on 'DIY' approach to meet their own immediate online social interaction and self-presentation needs. We conducted semi-structured interviews supported by live demonstrations of participants' own systems and their social media profiles, to address the following questions:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>What are the main motivations of digital makers in replacing or supplementing mainstream social media use with their own personal  systems?</li>
          <li>How do their uses of (if any) and feelings about mainstream social media compare and contrast with their own personal sites?</li>
          <li>What challenges do digital makers face regarding competing discourses from different social contexts, and how do they address these?</li>
        </ol>

      <h3>Study Design</h3>
      <div>

        <p>With the wide availability of different social platforms, people often tend to use one or more to manage their online social activities
        {[}cite{]}. Different platforms are tailored to various types of
        preferences, philosophies and purposes, and target different communities
        and individuals needs (social, professional, leisure). In this research
        we are interested in identifying and investigating individuals who
        desire the same 'type' of interactions that come through using
        mainstream social networking sites, but maintain their own platform
        (e.g. blog or website) as the focal point for, and primary source of,
        their online activities.</p>

        <p>We designed interview questions to encourage participants to reflect on
        their activities, rather than just recount them. The intention was not
        to compare their experiences with particular systems, but rather their
        motivations and habits, and ideas and feelings about the ways in which
        they interact online.</p>

        <section id="smm-participants" rel="schema:haspart">
          <h4>Participant Recruitment</h4>
          <div>

            <p>From the existing literature we can see similarities and differences in
            habits and motivations of bloggers and social media users. What we
            haven't heard about are social media `makers', who occupy some space in
            between.</p>

            <p>Such individuals must be technically competent or willing and able to
            learn. They share the DIY attitude with maker communities who engage in
            physical/hardware ... described by .. as ... {[}cites{]} but
            in the digital realm. In the same way hardware hackers seek to
            understand and control their physical day-to-day environment {[}cite{]},
            digital makers who see social media as a core part of their everyday
            lives are engaging in similar practices online.</p>

            <p>Social media makers are different too from the open source software
            developers who work on decentralised social platforms like GNU Social,
            Friendica, pump.io or Diaspora. That's not to say they are mutually
            exclusive and indeed many participate in several projects which are
            relevant to their interests in this space; but makers focus on building
            systems which affect their own lives primarily, and for use by others,
            secondarily.</p>

            <p>We recruited suitable participants through distributing an online signup
            form in IRC channels and online forums known to be frequented by
            individuals engaged in building personal websites and social media
            systems, and asking those who responded to refer others they know. The
            signup form included a brief description of suitable
            participants so that people were able to self-select for the study.</p>

            <p>The signup form asked for demographic information (age, gender,
            occupation, ethnicity, country of residence) as well as a list of
            personal websites and social media sites they use on a regular basis.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
   
        <section id="smm-study-method" rel="schema:haspart">
          <h4>Study Method</h4>
          <div>

            <p>Participants were asked 7 opening or closing questions, and a set of 5
            questions about each of their personal sites and each of their social
            media profiles, so the total number of questions depended on the number
            of personal sites and social platforms they used. We enquired about
            their motivations for building their own platforms, the particular
            functions they use them for, and about their audience. We asked
            similarly about how they use social networking sites, their audiences
            there, and how the functionality and audience overlap or differ between
            their personal sites and different social networking sites.</p>

            <p>We conducted semi-structured interviews in order to gain a first-hand
            account of participants' experiences with building and using their
            personal social media systems. We used the list of sites and systems
            gathered during recruitment as a starting point and encouraged
            participants to click around their websites and profiles during the
            interview, and we recorded a screencast of the process. This served as a
            prompt for both the interviewer and participant which allowed us to
            tailor the conversation around the participant's particular experiences.
            It also aided participants in accurately recalling the systems they use,
            as well as backing up their anecdotes with specific examples from their
            personal sites or social streams. We also allowed participants to show
            and discuss sites they had not initially reported if they wanted to do
            so.</p>

            <p>The interviews took place across a variety of different locations
            convenient to the individual participants. All but one participant used
            their own laptops when viewing their websites and social media profiles,
            so things were set up how they were used to day to day. Participants
            were permitted to pause the screen recording and/or audio at any time
            during the interview if it made them more comfortable.</p>

            <p>We used open ended questions as a guideline, but allowed participants to
            deviate freely to other topics if prompted by one of the questions, or
            something on their screen.</p>

            <p>Participants were rewarded with a 15usd gift voucher for their time.</p>

          <h4>Trustworthiness of data</h4>
          <div>
            <p>While qualitative semi-structured interview is the appropriate method to
            gather people's different types of usages, motivating factors and
            associated examples, it also presents several challenges. Qualitative
            data gathering may suffer from a lack of detailed or accurate
            recollection of events; participants might report their perception or
            general trends instead of specific descriptions of their activities, and
            may be unable to report on unconscious influences or motivations.
            Participants may also deliberately withhold or distort information.
            Using this methodology some information can be misinterpreted or
            overlooked.</p>
      
            <ul>
              <li>Detailed recollection of use: We asked participants to visit their
              sites and profiles and answer questions based on what was on screen.
              This was done in order to situate their reasons and preferences with
              concrete examples, and to be able to interpret their responses in
              context, and enquire further prompted by what was visible if
              necessary.</li>
              <li>Perceptions vs. actual actions: In order to gather users' activities
              accurately we asked them to provide specific examples to support their
              responses, which they were able to show us on their screen.</li>
              <li>Witholding or distorting information: Participants were informed that
              they could decline to answer any question, or could answer questions
              without being recorded, in order to mitigate against their feeling
              obliged to provide any response to questions they may uncomfortable
              with. Participants were able to answer vaguely if they preferred,
              rather than giving granular detail that may be inaccurate.</li>
              <li>Detailed information required vs. study length: In order to avoid a
              fatigue effect we asked participants to start with their personal
              sites, and then prioritised the social media platforms they felt they
              used the most. The study session was scheduled to run for 60 minutes,
              with an additional 30 minutes buffer for participants who wished to
              talk for longer.</li>

            <p>We take a grounded theory approach to analysing the data gathered.</p>

            <p>Immediately following each interview, the interviewer recorded pertinent
            words or phrases and notable highlights from the discussion, as well as
            a general impression. These notes were compiled into a preliminary set
            of codes in order to begin the process of identifying potential themes.
            We carried out inductive thematic analysis on the interview responses in
            several stages:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Listening to the interview recordings and transcribing to
              re-familiarise with the responses. Taking snapshots from the screen
              recording to include in the transcript when something on screen was
              explicitly referred to.</li>
              <li>Coding the transcripts, beginning with the list of phrases from the
              initial interview notes, but adding to this list throughout. Each
              transcript was passed through at least twice and re-coded to account
              for new codes which emerged later during the process.</li>
              <li>Noting relationships between the codes and how they co-occur, and
             categorising the codes to identify broader themes.</li>
              <li>Reviewing themes to understand how they overlap or relate to one
              another, and refining them to make sure themes are distinct.
              Identifying related topics which are missing from the data.</li>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <div>
        <p>13 interviews were conducted in person, and 2 over video chat. 10 of
        these took place during or after one of three technical events,
        conveniently over the same week in nearby cities, which were of interest
        to and therefore well attended by our target participants.</p>

        <p>All participants work or study in the technology industry, which is
        typical of our ``social media makers'' target, though not all work in
        web development. 11 participants identified as male, 3 as female and one
        declined to answer. A majority of participants are white; two listed
        their ethnicity as Hispanic or Latino, one as Jewish and one as Asian,
        and two declined to respond. All are resident in North America or
        Europe. These biases are reflective of the technology industry and the
        routes through which we were able to recruit participants. Our target
        community is niche and in its early stages, and as such our recruiting
        options were limited, so we acknowledge that the conclusions we draw
        from our results cannot be generalised to a broader population.</p>

        <p>Interviews lasted between 45 and 90 minutes, and participants discussed
        between 1 and 4 personal websites, and between 1 and 9 social
        networking sites (mean 4.7). Some paused screen recording when typing in passwords
        or if they were interrupted by incoming chat messages when browsing
        social media. None paused the recording in order to show the interviewer
        something 'off the record'.</p>

        <p>Participants talked about a combination of personal social experiences
        both on and offline, including how their online activities affect or are
        affected by their every day lives; their feelings about others working
        or experimenting in the decentralised social web domain; things they
        have accomplished and things they want or plan to accomplish in future;
        and technical details of systems they have built themselves. In many
        cases, participants naturally held a discussion which covered answers to
        our guideline questions without explicit prompting.</p>

        <p>Across all of the participants there was diversity in both systems used and the main emphases of conversation, however there are many common threads around <em>control</em> and <em>audience</em>, which we discuss here.</p>

          <h4>The network</h4>
          <div>
            <p>All participants maintained personal sites, and all used profiles on one
            or more major centralised social media services. All but one
            participant cross-posted content from their personal site to social
            media sites to some degree, referring to this process as
            ``syndication'', which may be manual or automatic.
            All participants said they need centralised services in order to reach their social
            network(s), as they did not expect their friends and family to go out of
            their way to read their personal website on a regular basis. Participant K had been involved in various open source social network projects, but missed his regular contacts: ``I was originally in like the GNU Social and Disapora... they didn't make a ton of sense because I didn't know anybody that was on them.'' Participant J agreed that he had looked at some open source projects, but didn't like their ``wholesale rejection of silos'' because his friends were still using centralised systems and he wants them to read the things he writes.</p>

            <p><blockquote>"Most of my friends are in silos, I want to be in those conversations and interact with them there, but I also want the control of both the data and the presentation... It's about interacting with people in silos while not being locked up in silos" (M)</blockquote></p>

            <p>However,
            most participants did not simply copy all content to all networks
            indiscriminately but employed a variety of policies when deciding which
            posts to syndicate where.</p>

            <p><strong>Contents:</strong> is the media or data or length of text
            contained in this post consistent with the type of content generally
            posted to this site? This could be a cultural constraint, or a technical
            restriction. Participant M says content must ``fit in'' so any inconsistencies from what's expected don't distract from the content itself. Participant E makes collages of photos to post because ``this is generally what people do on Pinterest'' and F points out the ``unspoken rules about what goes on there and how people interact''.</p>

            <p>Does the content cover a subject appropriate
            to discuss on the third-party platform? Participant N wouldn't write academic things on Facebook for fear of boring people.</p>

            <p><strong>Frequency of posts:</strong> Almost 75\% of participants were worried about
            creating undue ``noise''. For example, only carefully selected photos
            are generally posted to Instagram, but a whole, uncurated set is
            uploaded to Flickr.</p>

            <p><blockquote>``On twitter nobody cares if you're too noisy, but on facebook they
            really do, they start complaining.'' (B)</blockquote></p>
            <p><blockquote>``I don't want to post too much and like dominate someone's feed... I wanted to post 20 photos today and I definitely feel a pressure not to do that because it's [being syndicated to] Instagram'' (I)</blockquote></p>

            <p><strong>Who will see it:</strong> is the content of the post appropriate for the
            connections they know they have on the third-party platform? Will the
            content be distributed publicly or privately on this platform? Is the
            anticipated level and type of engagement with the content by others
            desirable?</p>

            <p>Participant B uses Medium to reach to people beyond his normal circles
            of ``affluent white men who work in tech''. Participant F withholds
            certain content from Facebook to avoid social-media-novice family
            members making unrelated personal comments which all of her other
            contacts can see. Participant I keeps his social media profiles fully
            private, even though they mirror the public content posted on his
            personal site, considering the interactions on Twitter ``too abusive and
            spammy'' for it to be worthwhile letting strangers comment on his posts.</p>

            <p><strong>What will it look like:</strong> 70\% think about how
            their content would be rendered on other networks when deciding whether
            to syndicate there, for example that short text-only notes look
            unappealing on facebook, but images and link previews are presented
            well, so they only syndicate content to facebook when it includes the
            latter.</p>

            <p>Even when posting primarily on their own website, the importance of the
            network means that participants are still bound to some extent by the
            norms and expectations of the communities and platforms used by their
            friends and contacts. Most participants found more freedom in posting to
            their own sites with regards to types of posts, content and posting
            frequency. However
            those who were more committed to cross-posting, or did not have tooling
            available to allow them to be selective about cross-posting, were
            strongly influenced by the other destinations for their content when
            making posting decisions, in some cases self-censoring their content or
            amending how it is presented.</p>

        <section id="results-decompartmentalisation" rel="schema:haspart">
          <h4>(De)compartmentalisation and audience</h4>
          <div>

            <p>One third of participants said they do not think about their audience, but 7 described how they are very aware of who might be reading their content, including that they revise content until they feel it is appropriate for multiple audiences they imagine might see it. 5 people say they primarily post for themselves, and 4 said that whilst they selectively cross-post subsets of content based on the norms and audience of third-party platforms, they actively want to collapse these contexts on their own site.</p>

            <p><blockquote>``I'm ready to collapse everything... I want to be as complete as possible... It'd be fun if I had a blog that's part let's say... Swift coding, and also part cute beefcake pictures.'' (J)</blockquote></p>

            <p>Some would consider filtering based on who was looking, if it was technically straightforward. However most don't care at all about audiences from different aspects of their lives coming across their posts, or imagine the audience for their site is so small that context collapse is unlikely. Some people even saw this as positive, describing it as ``healthy'' (M, I) or ``more human'' (I). 4 acknowledged their privilege as non-vulnerable members of society which allowed them to feel this way.</p>

            <p>Despite this, 7 participants said they post pseudonymously or anonymously in other systems which are completely disconnected from their primary online identity. This is usually about sensitive topics that they are not willing to share more broadly, and don't trust their own technical expertise to build sufficent access control into their own systems.</p>

        <section id="results-self-expression" rel="schema:haspart">
          <h4>Self-expression</h4>
          <div>
            <p>Despite the uses for centralised systems in terms of network reach and audience management, one aspect of \emph{control} desired by participants is how they are able to express themselves.</p>

            <p><strong>Self-expression through visuals: </strong>Participants cared a lot about what their websites look like. Three quarters said
            that having creative control over the appearance of their content was
            one of their main motivations for publishing on their own site. For
            some, this stemmed from wanting `clean and simple' visuals as opposed to
            the `noisy' interfaces of Facebook and Twitter. For others, it was
            important that they had freedom to experiment.</p>

            <p><blockquote>``I like playing with the form. I think the thing about cookie cutter
            sites is that they are one size fits all. And I think form in some ways
            dictates content and so if you're publishing on a network things you are
            writing are lead by what's already on the network. If you've got your
            own site it's like starting form scratch you can just dictate exactly
            what's there, you can choose your own identity, you can have a huge say
            over what you're publishing.'' - B</blockquote></p>

            <p>Participant L showed other peoples' sites he was inspired by visually,
            including one which uses a unique design for each individual blog post.
            Participant N publishes his art on his site - alongside his technical and academic essays - which involves running code, so he is unable to use existing platforms.</p>

            <p>Participant I has archives dating back over a decade, and for many years
            experimented with a different design every month. These designs are
            frozen in time, so
            clicking back through these archives reveals radical changes in visuals
            which capture moods, ideas and experiments from the time the posts were
            written: </p>

            <p><blockquote>``I could easily try out a new style knowing that I
            wasn't committing all my archives or the future to this style.'' He was
            convinced these temporal visuals were ``worth preserving'' by his own
            memories of blog posts he'd read looking a certain way, and the
            associations or even nostalgia that come with that when articles are
            re-discovered. The same participant periodically makes time-limited
            or post-specific updates to his visual style, and compares this with the way 
            people change their profile pictures on social media to support a 
            particular cause.</blockquote></p>

            </figure>

            <p>When interacting with others in their community, participants may post a message on their own site which triggers a notification to the addressee, who will often display the reply. Despite their strong feelings over how their posts are presented on their own site or on social media, no participants whose replies are displayed on another <em>homegrown</em> site were concerned with how their message is presented there, so long as the content itself is unchanged. The domain owner is within their rights to display incoming content in their own space however they see fit.</p>

            <p><strong>Self-expression through voice: </strong>Over half of participants were worried about their self expression being 
            compromised through censorship or not being able to use their own voice.
            One participant, only recently returned to personal publishing, stopped
            posting on his own site and on social media for several years after a
            post about his gay relationship resulted in an
            unpleasant message from his father. As he became increasingly reclusive
            online, this started to reflect into his offline life as well, and he
            withdrew socially. Recently he realised this wasn't healthy and made a
            concerted effort to become more expressive, more confident in his identity
            and to be ``forward'' about his experiences as a queer software developer.
            Following this, he very deliberately won't be concealing parts
            of himself going forward. He now finds ``joy in intersections'' of the different
            parts of his life and adds that on your own domain, ``no-one can tell you that you can't call yourself whatever you want.''</p>

            <p>Participant L cares deeply about the visuals of his site, but ultimately sees 
            them as something that will change: ``content will always represent me more than any visual design will, because visual designs come and go.'' As a result, he does not display any content created by others: ``I want every pixel on my site to be mine.''</p>

            <p><strong>Self-expression through functionality: </strong>60\% of participants appreciate the ability to create types of content that
            no other social systems allow, and to mix and match the types of content they 
            post all in one place, agreeing with the sentiment: "it's my site I can post whatever I want" (I). 11 participants described things they do with their own systems that they cannot get elsewhere, including adding licenses (L), editing or deleting posts (I, O), posting events or RSVPs (A, I), custom lists, logs or channels (A, E, G, K, L).</p>

        <section id="results-empowerment" rel="schema:haspart">
          <h4>Empowerment</h4>
          <div>
            <p>Participants varied in how they felt their personal sites empowered them, beyond self-expression. For some it was about ownership. Participant J expressed concern that his generation rarely own things, from cars and houses, to music, and his personal site was a way of claiming something back: ``my personal website at the center or origin of my ideas... it's like expanding my own real estate.''</p>

            <p>However participant B pointed out that ``owning your own stuff is only useful if you can actually control it... if you're not a developer that's actually disempowering'' and participant L describes personal data ownership as ``a tool toward autonomy. Just owning a lot of stuff doesn't give you control or freedom or agency.''</p>

            <p>75\% want a place under their control to be the <em>canonical</em> source of their content; the definitive location for their online persona. Participant I's personal site is entirely public, yet his social media profiles - to where all of his posts are syndicated - are locked down, ``to encourage people, if they wanted to share something that I tweeted, to then share my original copy instead on my website.''</p>

        <section id="results-longevity" rel="schema:haspart">
          <h4>Longevity</h4>
          <div>
            <p>12 participants expressed the importance of being able to archive their content and data. They wanted copies. If a centralised service disappears or bars their access - something which has happened at some point to every participant - most now have their content and often the context of conversations with others, on their own servers. Participant G ``had no idea Geocities would go away.''</p>

            <p>For some, this is also about personal development, reflection, and spotting patterns in their behaviour over time. ``I like being able to have a record of everything I've published over the last ten years and being able to come back to it and go oh this is what I thought about this back then'' (B). Participant L thinks we should take a 2000 year view of our digital lives, and that we all have a right to store personal data ``cradle-to-grave... that will live on untouched after our death'' to benefit future societies.</p>

        <section id="results-ephemerality" rel="schema:haspart">
          <h4>Ephemerality</h4>
          <div>
            <p>Nonetheless, 7 participants create content with the expectation that it will disappear, and see value in being able to do this, and 4 participants explicitly consider social media to be a place for ephemeral content. ``I feel that I'm much more responsible for what I post... whereas on twitter you're part of the faceless hoarde'', said F, explaining why she posts throwaway or snarky comments to twitter without bothering to archive them in her own space. Many participants treat facebook replies and likes the same way: ``if it's a comment on someone else's post I'm assuming it's pretty much throwaway. I write assuming it could last forever, but I also write assuming that if it got deleted for any reason I wouldn't care... doublethink'' (I). However several participants expressed that they would archive certain types of content if they could, but at present the technical barrier is too high, and their priority for doing so is too low.</p>

          <h4>Consent</h4>
          <div>
            <p>Another aspect of control is consent. Many members of the community use common tooling to fetch replies from social media to the syndicated copies of their posts. There are privacy safeguards in the tooling that prevent private or access controlled posts from being exposed publicly, but 4 participants either didn't do this, despite a desire for archives, or expressed misgivings about the fact they were: ``it feels a little bit weird to be pulling people's stuff without their consent'' (B) because most contacts on social media were unaware of the possibility that their content would be copied to somewhere else on the Web; somewhere potentially more likely to be indexed by search engines.</p>

        <section id="results-abuse-and-surveillance" rel="schema:haspart">
          <h4>Abuse and surveillance</h4>
          <div>
            <p>Participant B once posted something which triggered a flood of reactions
            from an infamously abusive online community. His tooling automatically pulled these 
            responses from social media, through to his personal site. Rather exercising
            his ability to remove these posts, he ``decided to keep it up and sort of showcase the idiots.'' Other participants consider themselves lucky not to have experienced
            this, and give little thought to how they would handle it.</p>

            <p>Though 7 participants ``don't write sensitive stuff on digital technology'' (N) none expressed concern about centralised systems mining the data they syndicate, or the terms of service they are agreeing to in doing so.</p>

            <p>Almost all participants said they were inspired by others in the community, and other personal sites they see on the Web. Some took specific ideas to do with visuals or the types of content they can post; others were just inspired by the movement towards data ownership in general. Some participants said they replicated features they like from centralised services.</p>

            <p>Half of participants said they built new functionality into their systems when their current way of doing something became too painful or inconvenient. Others want to keep up with the trends in the community in general, so they implement new features in order to continue interoperating with others, or just to try things out. Many said they update their systems when they have enough free time to do so, and have long todo lists of things they want to achieve.</p>

            <p>Most were triggered to update their bios on both their personal sites and across their social media profiles when something changed in their life. Except for participant O, who updated specifically when he realised he would need to give his URL(s) to someone and didn't want his information to be out of date.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <div>
        <p>The ``digital makers'' we interviewed revealed their primary motivations 
        in replacing or supplementing mainstream social media use with their own
        personal systems are <em>control</em> of their online representation, and
        over the longevity (or not) of their content, and <em>decompartmentalising</em> or 
        making a canonical source for all aspects of their online presence.</p>

        <p>Participants who feel over-constrained by the limitations of social media 
        with regards to the kinds of content they can create and how it must be laid out 
        or displayed have developed their own completely custom publishing environments 
        in order to more freely express themselves. They demonstrate many creative 
        ways of displaying similar types of content to that ordinarily found on 
        social media, as well as innovating with new ``post types'' or ways of sharing 
        information that they cannot do elsewhere at all. This freedom to experiment 
        leads them to reflect on and perhaps better understand their identities. Further, participants feel 
        empowered by the ability to archive their content for life, or hide or remove content from their own 
        space as they like.</p>

        <p>Participants remain in touch with their network through cross-posting
        content to mainstream social media channels, and in some cases backfeeding interactions 
        and conversation threads from there to their own personal sites. A result of this 
        is that the content they post is still influenced by the platforms they know it will 
        end up being seen on. A technique to mitigate against
        violating norms on other platforms or encountering technical barriers is to be selective
        when cross-posting. Though there is no hard and fast formula to follow, participants
        commonly consider audience, visuals, content types, posting frequency, and topics as part of a gut intuition when making these decisions.</p>

    <section id="profile-intro" rel="schema:haspart">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <div>

        <p>In order to build on our understanding of the role an online profile plays in self-presentation, identity and interaction we need a more nuanced understanding of what a ‘profile’ <em>is</em> in a general sense. What is the <em>meaning</em> of <em>profile</em>? I carried out an empirical analysis of digital representations of users on 18 different online systems. <span class="notes">The following is handwaving, needs fixing:</span> From these we derive a set of constructs to capture  features of profiles in online systems and evaluate this framework by classifying a further 10 systems according to it (or something). We propose this as groundwork for deriving requirements for profiles when designing new systems which need digital representations of their users, as well as for assessing the benefits and drawbacks of how profiles are implemented in existing systems in such a way that takes into account the contexts in which they are used. Once we have a characterisation of a particular type of profile a system enables, we can use these as control features in comparing systems.. future work is to see how the features of a profile might influence users/community formation.</p>
        <p class="notes">Maybe use stuff in participation and interaction of social machines taxonomy http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/362359/1/SOCIAM%20Classificationv2.pdf Could see this as a further breakdown of one of the U categories (see also their methodology pg 13) “Given the value of taxonomies in advancing our understanding of the conceptual landscape associated with a domain”. Taxonomy is very sort of task/activity centric rather than about individuals.</p>

        <section id="profiles-method" rel="schema:haspart">
          <h4>Method</h4>
          <div>

            <p>I started with the following areas to investigate:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Data contained within a profile.</li>
              <li>How profile data may be accessed by others.</li>
              <li>How profile data may be distributed or pushed to others.</li>
              <li>The role of profile data within the broader system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The starting point for a 'profile' was typically a URL or dataset including a username or other unique identifier for an entity (which could be an individual or group). After initial explorations of the profiles in a few systems, these areas were refined into specific questions to answer about each:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>What does a profile contain?</li>
              <li>How are profiles updated?</li>
              <li>How are people notified when a profile is updated?</li>
              <li>How is access to a profile controlled?</li>
              <li>How are profiles within a system connected together?</li>
              <li>How can profiles be exported from or imported into a system?</li>
              <li>What constraints are placed on a profile?</li>
              <li>How do profiles fit in with a systems apparent data model?</li>
              <li><em>What</em> is the profile for?</li>
              <li><em>Who</em> is the profile for?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I took one system at a time, and answered all of the questions by logging in (where applicable) to my own account and observing the behaviours of the system in response to interactions with my own and other users' profiles (where necessary), and took screenshots. I also read systems' terms of service, and about pages, introductory descriptions or statements of purpose, and leaned on my own background knowledge of how the systems are used by myself and others.</p>

            <p>Having answered all of the questions about each system, I passed through each one again to confirm, and add more detail if necessary, and I noted similarities and differences between systems. From the results, I derived a set of potential <em>features</em> for profiles, and ranked each system according to how it used these features. This allowed some clustering of similar systems into a general categorisation framework. <span class="todo"> Please tell me there's an actual named method for this?</span></p>

            <p>Eighteen social systems were selected for the initial analysis phase. Something is considered a 'social system' in this case where users engage with it in order to create a Web-based representation or description of themselves of some kind. Most are ordinary websites which one uses by registering, then logging in and out. Some include or require self-hosted software.</p>

            <p>These systems were selected <span class="todo">...</span> and only systems with which I have personal experience were chosen, in order to take advantage of latent background knowledge when navigating the systems.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><em>Blogs</em> are "special types of websites that usually display date-stamped entries in reverse chronological order"</li>
              <li><em>Social Networking Sites</em> are "applications that enable users to connect by creating personal information profiles, inviting friends and colleagues to have access to those profiles, and sending ... messages between each other"</li>
              <li><em>Collaborative Projects</em> "enable the joint and simultaneous creation of content by many end-users"</li>
              <li><em>Content Community</em> for "the sharing of media content between users"</li>
              <li><em>Virtual Gaming Worlds</em> are "platforms that replicate a three-dimensional environment in which users can appear in the form of personalized avatars and interact with each other ... according to strict rules in the context of a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG)"</li>
              <li><em>Virtual Social Worlds</em> "allows inhabitants to choose their behavior more freely ... there are no rules restricting the range of possible interactions"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We include the first four of these in the <a href="#profiles-subjects-table">table below</a><sup>k</sup>, as well as extending this categorisation with <em>Quantified Self</em> (life-logging or self-tracking; automated or manual recording of minutiae of daily life) and <em>Transactional</em> (networks that exist for exchange of goods or services) in order to accommodate new types of systems which have emerged since.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <div>
          <p class="notes">https://github.com/rhiaro/profiles/blob/master/study.md</p>

          <p>Here I summarise the findings of the study. Detailed tables of results are available in <a href="">Appendix X</a>.</p>

          <p>The most distinct of the systems is the Indieweb wiki, which largely functions as an ordinary wiki except that one identifies oneself with a domain name (logging in with the <a href="https://indieweb.org/indieauth">IndieAuth authentication protocol</a>) and thus the 'profile' is tied to one's personal blog, website, or homepage. As a result, profiles are highly custom and diverse, but even though they are not hosted centrally by the wiki software they are the main source of identification between users of the wiki, so they are considered here in the same way as the other systems. In order to study them without visiting the domains of every single user, I also make use of the contents of the wiki itself, which is focused around documenting and recommending best practices for creating a social Web presence; that is, I assume that practices relevant to profile creation described the wiki are adopted by a majority of users.</p>

          <section id="profiles-what" rel="schema:haspart">
            <h4>What does a profile contain?</h4>
            <div>

            <p>Profiles contain some combination of: <strong>attributes</strong> (key-value pairs of data); <strong>content</strong> (text or media) created by the profile owner; a list of <strong>activities</strong> or interactions the profile owner has carried out in the system; <strong>links to profiles</strong> with which they are connected; <strong>links to content</strong> the profile owner has interacted with (eg. 'likes'); links to <strong>collections</strong> of content curated by the profile owner; <strong>statistics</strong> about the profile (eg. 'member since'); automatically generated <strong>rankings</strong> or ratings of the profile owner; reviews, messages or content <strong>left by other</strong> members of the network.</p>

            <p>All of the 18 systems use attributes in the profile, and none use <em>only</em> attributes. Attributes may be generic (such as <em>name</em>, <em>bio</em>, <em>location</em>), as well as tailored to the specific system (<em>countries I've visited</em> on CouchSurfing; <em>knows about</em> on Quora; <em>looking for</em> on OkCupid). Some attribute values are offered as a fixed set to choose from, and others permit free-text input. Some systems may require a minimum input of certain attributes, and some leave everything entirely optional.</p>

            <p>Facebook has the broadest array of possible attributes, including the possibility to create your own keys, and use ones that others have created. CouchSurfing and OkCupid make extensive use of free text input, prompting users to write short essay-style answers to certain questions. Most systems encourage an avatar or display picture, and several also permit uploading a prominent header image (also known as 'banner' or 'cover photo'). The Indieweb community bases attribute-style profile content around the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card">microformats h-card</a> specifications, which provides a fixed set, all optional.</p>

            <p>Indieweb profiles tend to be the homepages of blogs (although they may be a more static 'about' page) and as such are heavy on the content and activities aspects. SNS like Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Pump.io, Friendica, also lend prominence to content (typically text-based status updates; often photos) and a feed of activities on the site. YouTube (obviously) incorporates videos created by the profile owner, and how these are organised is highly customiseable. For users who have not uploaded video, YouTube profiles contain mostly attributes and activities, and elevate interactions with other content on the site, such as commenting on videos, adding to playlists, and subscribing to channels.</p>

            <p>Activity feeds in general vary in their level of detail. Quora includes if someone edited a question or answer. Pump.io distinguishes between 'major' and 'minor' activities, displaying them in separate feeds. Amongst posts by the profile owner, Twitter includes a heavily algorithmically curated subset of activites, such as recent follows or likes. Most sites do not include a complete log of all of the possible interactions however. For example, CouchSurfing enables a rich array of activities, from offering to host a guest, to posting in group forums and arranging events; but none of these are displayed on a user's profile. Similarly, most systems do not display a feed of changes to attributes of the profile, which could also be considered activities.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, when users interact with other content on a system, for example by liking or favouriting it or adding it to a collection (a playlist on YouTube), reblogging it on Tumblr, voting on it on Quora or StackOverflow; this content becomes part of the profile.</p> 

            <p>StackOverflow, GitHub, PeoplePerHour, ResearchGate, Quora and RunKeeper are very statistics-oriented. RunKeeper focusses on a feed of offline activities, calculating for example how many calories you lost this week from logged exercise, or how far you ran. GitHub visualises code commits and 'contributions' (ie. helpful interactions with others' projects) in a coloured grid. ResearchGate and Quora display statistics about how much others have interacted with the profile owner's content. OkCupid also generates statistics based on answers to short, multiple-choice personal questions, and these statistics are dependent on who is viewing the profile, eg. percentage romantic match, and things like '30% more social'.</p>

            <p>Sites which make heavy use of content left by others on a profile are CouchSurfing, AirBnB, and PeoplePerHour. Each of these display reviews of the profile owner by other users, typically in a way that cannot be amended or removed. Facebook allows one to 'write on the wall' of another profile, but users can disable this. However, comments and likes by other users commonly show up alongside activities or created content on a profile as well. LinkedIn prompts users to 'endorse' one another for particular skills, and these endorsements are prominent on profiles. StackOverflow and Quora aggregate ratings left by others on content into overall numbers or rankings to display on profiles.</p>

            <p>Many systems give prominence to the connections with other users in the system; LinkedIn displays neither likes nor status updates on the profile, but emphasises contacts and the network around them; Twitter displays followers and following; YouTube displays subscriptions and subscribers; ResearchGate, Pump.io, Friendica, and Quora similarly.</p>

            <pre class="notes">**Indieweb**: Attributes (fixed as per microformats2 but extensible), authored content.

**Twitter**: Attributes (fixed set), connections (subset), authored content, activities within the network (heavily curated).

**Tumblr**: Content; original posts and reposts. Attributes: username, blog title, blog description. (Separate page for likes which is optionally public). No stats by default.

**Pump.io**: Attributes (name, hometown, bio, avatar) and content (major in main feed) and activities (minor down the side) (ActivityStreams)

**YouTube**: channel art, display picture, content (videos), liked videos, created playlists, curated connections, featured content. Links to: attributes (description, links, country); stats (subs, views, joined); discussion (comments on your content).

          <section id="profiles-updates" rel="schema:haspart">
            <h4>How are profiles updated?</h4>
            <div>

              <p>This includes how profiles are updated by profile owners via a system's user interface, as well as how profiles can be updated programmatically through an API. I posit that the options presented for modifying a profile can influence how users make use of a system for their self-presentation. Programmatic access suggests that third-party applications (outside of the system itself) can also influence a profile owner's view on the possibilities of the profile.</p>

              <p>Most systems provide a Web form to add or update attributes, or a similar UI in a native mobile application. In some cases, the form fields appear where the information appears on the profile itself (Twitter, Quora, LinkedIn, ResearchGate) and in some the updating interface is completely divorced from the final view of the profile; in some cases, both depending on the attributes (Facebook, OkCupid). Indieweb profiles are updated with custom editing interfaces, or simply by editing static HTML; there are currently no specific recommendations for protocols or UIs to edit profile attributes.</p>

              <p>For the non-attribute data which makes up a profile, separate, often specialised, interfaces for both Web and mobile exist, eg. for posting status updates or media content. For data like statistics and activities, this content is generated by algorithms or sensors, with no explicit input from the profile owner. In a few cases it may be hidden, but rarely changed. An exception is RunKeeper, where one can edit an automatically generated GPS trace after the fact, which can correct distance and speed records. On CouchSurfing, AirBnB and PeoplePerHour, one may respond to a review left by someone else, but not remove it.</p>

              <p>Only Pump.io, ... HERENOW APIs</p>

              <pre class="notes">**Indieweb**: not spec'd (likely editing static HTML).

**Twitter**: Web form / client UI.

API:

WAIT THESE ARE ALL GET. No POST for update o.O

* `/user/info`: following, default_post_format, name, likes, blogs [name, url, title, primary (bool), followers, tweet (bool), facebook (bool), type (pub/priv)]
* `/user/dashboard` (which is feed of what they see that they're subscribed to etc)
* `/user/likes`, `/user/following`

**Tumblr**: Web form, mixed in with blog appearance/settings.

**Pump.io**: Web form / client UI

API:

```
To create a new user, POST a user representation (see below) to the list.

The JSON object representing the user has the following properties:

* nickname: The user's nickname. 1-64 characters, including only ASCII capital and lowercase letters and numbers as well as "-", ".", and "_". The nickname is immutable and unique per server; it can't be changed.
* password: The plain-text password. This isn't returned when you GET the user object, but you have to provide it when registering or updating the user.
* profile: a "person" object. This is created automatically when you create a new user; don't try to add it yourself. Don't update this directly; update the person through its object endpoint.
```

**YouTube**: Web form(s) / client UI

**CouchSurfing**: Web form

**Facebook**: Various web forms, some inline.

```
You can update a User by making a POST request to /{user_id}.

**Twitter**: All or nothing for content. A blocked user can still see some attributes (avatar, banner, name). Protected accounts show all profile data but not content or followers/ing

**Tumblr**: "a primary blog is public facing", secondary blogs can be password protected. Per-blog basis.

No automatic links between primary and secondary blogs, and no way to tell if a blog is primary or secondary, or who which user owns a secondary blog (even from API without trial and error).

You can block users: they can't follow, send fan mails or asks, see your posts in their dashboard, like, reblog or reply to your posts, see you in search results.

Can grant write access and transfer admin between users for secondary blogs.

**Pump.io**: Individual resources can be addressed to groups or users, but profile attributes are all public (but none required). No anonymous activities. No way to invisibly do minor activities.

**YouTube**: Pretty granular. pub/priv: liked videos, saved playlists, subscriptions; subscribers. exist or not: name, country, keywords. Appear as a recommended channel on/off.

**CouchSurfing**: Most things optional. Options: First or full name; restrict to log in members.

**Facebook**: Can restrict access to individual attributes on profile. Also per-post. Can set defaults to include or exclude people/groups/public/networks. Super complex. Can restrict findability of profile. Can set commeting access on public posts and profile info separately (ie. read and write acl are separate).

**Quora**: Online presence on/off. Nothing for profile attributes. Can choose to ask/answer as Anonymous, but still logged in.

**Okcupid**: Requires okc login on/off. Nothing required.

**StackOverflow**: Most fields optional, not granular visibility.

**LinkedIn**: Some individual attributes visibility: My Connections / My Network / Everyone. Public profile visible to: No-one / Everyone with on/off for (Basics, Picture, Headline, Websites, Summary, Skills, Organisations, Groups). Connections: Connections / Only You. Public posts: Everyone / Connections. Activity feed: Everyone / Network / Connections / Only You.

**PeoplePerHour**: Show hourlies on/off. Index by search engines on/off.

**ResearchGate**: Research data: everyone / mutual followers / researchgate members. If you've read other peoples' on/off. Fixed on/off settings for some things: public profile, photo, questions and answers.

**AirBnB**: Some things are private by default. Social connections to share activity on fb only with other airbnb users, and suck some data through from fb. Hosts can require certain profile attributes are filled in.

**Friendica**: Tags have separate fields for public/private. Friends/contacts visibility on/off. Everything optional. "This is your public profile. It may be visible to anybody using the internet."

**Zooniverse**: All optional.

**runkeeper**: 'Sharing' Everyone/Friends/Just Me, profile things in groups of different levels of granularity (body measurements, weight, diabetes, nutrition, sleep, activities). Anything not in this list is an optional thing to fill in I guess, ie no way to say 'name' is friends only.

**github**: Most optional, can choose to keep email private.</pre>

**Twitter**: One directional; notifications sometimes sent to your followers when you follow someone, especially if others in your network also do; follows (some? all? curated how?) appear in your timeline; no notifications of unfollows; configurable notification when someone follows you.

**Tumblr**: `Follow` a blog. (Not a user).

**Pump.io**: `Follow` a user. Minor activity and notification when someone follows you. Added to 'follows' collection (public). One way.

**YouTube**: `Subscribe` to a channel, one way.

**CouchSurfing**: Friends - specify hosted/surft/traveled/never met, and closeness. Couch request/offer (but this doesn't create a persistant connection). References.

**Facebook**: Friends - mutual, accept/reject request. You can choose to let anyone 'follow' your public posts (or not). You can follow pages. Following is one way.

**Quora**: follow a user (one way)

**Okcupid**: Like/bookmark (same thing, interchangeable language). Only revealed if mutual.

**StackOverflow**: none? RSS feeds for user activity..

**StackOverflow**:

```
Subscriber shall provide Stack Exchange with accurate, complete, and updated registration information, including Subscriber’s e-mail address.

**PeoplePerHour**:

```
To use PPH, Users have to register for an account, provide accurate and complete information, and keep their account information updated. Both Buyers and Sellers undergo the same account registration process.
Each account must be a personal account, but Users may trade as a sole trader, company or any other legal entity (whether incorporated or unincorporated).
Users cannot register for more than one account.
The information that Users supply in the public profile of their account must comply with PPH profile policies (http://support.peopleperhour.com/hc/en-us/articles/205218177-Profile-policies)

Your profile is your “shop front” as a Seller so it is recommended that you invest the time to include as much information as you can to highlight your skills and credentials.   When creating your profile we have a few policies that Sellers are expected to adhere to.  These policies form part of our T&Cs.

 

Do

make sure that all of the information contained in your profile is a true and accurate representation.  Including your name, location and details of your credentials;
include a professional image of yourself as your profile image.  You can choose to have your company logo instead however we strongly recommend a personal photo instead.  The PPH marketplace is built on trust and personal photos rather than logos have been shown to make a significant difference to success;
include as profile cover a quality image or photo of yourself or a scenery. Avoid excessive amount of text keeping it to the length of a tagline. You can include visual representation of your work or part of your actual portfolio if visual.
Don't

include your full name, or contact details in your profile description, cover image, portfolio items or any other section of your profile.  This rule is first and foremost to protect you; we would discourage you from publishing your contact details visibly on any public site.
open more than one user account with PeoplePerHour.  Duplicate accounts will be closed;
include any links to your website or any third party website anywhere in your profile including your profile image or portfolio images;
upload any content to your profile that breaches our terms and conditions including all the obvious things like abusive, offensive, defamatory or infringing content.
share your bank account or any other withdrawal method. Such practice is against our Terms and Conditions of Website Use and leads to permanent account suspension.
```

**ResearchGate**: Nothing to do with profiles?!

**AirBnB**:

```
Your Airbnb Account and your Airbnb Account profile page will be created for your use of the Site and Application based upon the personal information you provide to us or that we obtain via an SNS as described above. You may not have more than one (1) active Airbnb Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Airbnb reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Airbnb Account and your access to the Site, Application and Services if you create more than one (1) Airbnb Account, or if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, fraudulent, not current or incomplete.

you will not: ...
* register for more than one Airbnb Account or register for an Airbnb Account on behalf of an individual other than yourself;
* unless Airbnb explicitly permits otherwise, request or book a stay at any Accommodation if you will not actually be staying at the Accommodation yourself;
* impersonate any person or entity, or falsify or otherwise misrepresent yourself or your affiliation with any person or entity;
```

**Friendica**: ToS per server presumably.

**Zooniverse**: Nothing profile related

**runkeeper**:

```
agree that you will not: ... (v) impersonate another person.
```

**github**:

```
You must be a human. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.

You must provide your name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process.

[This](https://github.com/friendica/friendica/blob/master/doc/Profiles.md) describes how alternative profiles work, but I can't find these settings in friendica.eu right now (I have seen them before for sure). You can create versions of yourself with different attributes, and assign them so certain people see certain profiles when the look at you. Ie. profiles as views on a person. Also your profile can be a different 'page type' which automates connections settings in different ways, eg. for celebrities.

**Zooniverse**: From http://www.arfon.org/how-the-zooniverse-works-the-domain-model

```
User

People are core to the Zooniverse. When talking publically about the Zooniverse I almost always use the term 'citizen scientist' or 'volunteer' because it feels like an appropriate term for someone who donates their time to one of our projects. When writing code however, the shortest descriptive term that makes sense is usually selected so in our domain model the term we use is User.

A User is exactly what you'd expect, it's a person, it has a bunch of information associated with it such as a username, an email address, information about which projects they've helped with and a host of other bits and bobs. Crucially though for us, a User is the same regardless of which project they're working - that is Users are pan-Zooniverse. Whether you're classiying galaxies over at Galaxy Zoo or identifying animals on Snapshot Serengeti we're associating your efforts with the same User record each time which turns out to be useful for a whole bunch of reasons (more later).
