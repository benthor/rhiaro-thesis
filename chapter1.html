  <h2>Background and context</h2>
  <div>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>The goal of this thesis is to bridge established social science research about self-presentation and impression management, with a practical, developer-centric perspective on building social web applications. We seek to understand how and why contemporary social networking systems both help and hinder individuals' expressive needs, and what people do to work around technical and social constraints they encounter during day to day use. What we learn from this, we can use to optimise future social systems for individual and collective empowerment.</p>

      <li>...</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This work is best situated in the field of Web Science, a multidisciplinary domain with a focus on the relationships between people and the technology that connects them. We draw particularly upon related work in digital sociology as well as computer science […]</p>

    <p class="todo">Web science framework: http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/263347/1/1800000001%5B1%5D.pdf</p>

    <p>Throughout this work we describe and advocate for particular visions of systems and technologies that we believe to be best practice, however it is important to note that such systems are not an end in themselves. The social changes that technologies enable are what matters. Thus we emphasise that while digital technology is constantly evolving, and subject to rapidly shifting political and technological landscapes […]peoples' needs and desires and perceived rights are also reconfigured by changing technology.</p>

      <h3>Conceputal framework</h3>
      <div>
        <p><strong>How can we access the bigger picture when it comes to understanding the impact of networked publics on presentation of self?</strong></p>
        <p>There is a multitude of work from the past two decades about self-presentation on the Web, from personal homepages and blogs to modern Social Network Sites. Ethnographic studies from social sciences and psychology investigate the impact of networked publics on people's everyday lives. Social media analysis studies from computer sciences look at network effects and finds patterns in how people connect and the data they publish. Whilst there is usually some overlap, the former tend to focus on people and the latter on technology. It would perhaps be unreasonable to expect anything else, for example, for social scientists to convey a profound understanding of the underlying systems their subjects engage with at every stage in their study. However, we are talking about socio-technical systems, and very complex ones at that. Networked publics cannot be properly understood without positioning an individual study against the contemporary background of what is occurring <em>both</em> socially and technically. Due to the sheer enormity of this task, much research fails to do this.</p>

        <p>In order to make this easier, we need a device which allows scholars to access and organise concepts relating to broader socio-technical systems, so that they can situate their more in-depth niche or specialised analyses on particular topics. This can be achieved by means of a conceputal framework which captures a hierarchy of concepts that are applicable to understanding self-presentation in networked publics.</p>

        <p>I begin by examining key concepts from relevant literature from both social sciences and computer sciences, and summarising a cross-section of findings from smaller scale studies about online social spaces in <a href="chapter2">chapter 2</a>. This sets the background for a series of studies of my own, which are described in <a href="chapter3">chapter 3</a>, and which are designed to tease out further diverse and novel considerations about social behaviour on the Web.</p>

        <p><a href="chapter3">Chapter 3</a> proceeds to attempt to answer this research question with one possiblity for a conceptual framework design, based on findings from existing literature and my own study results.</p>

      <h3>Changing dynamics</h3>
      <div>
        <p><strong>How does self-presentation change depending on the power dynamics of the Social Web services they use?</strong></p>
        <p>Next, I acknowledge the changing times of the Social Web. I believe (and hope) we are on the verge of an important transition from a world in which our personal data is stored and harnessed by powerful third-parties at great (but often unseen) cost to individuals. One route for this transition is by way of <em>decentralisation</em>, that is, by dispersing power from the few to the many. In terms of software for the Social Web, decentralisation entails making it possible for diverse systems to communicate without prior arrangement, to form spontaneous connections and pass data around seamlessly. Achieving this comes with both technical and social challenges, and to succeed would impact online social behaviour in ways we may not yet be prepared for.</p>

        <p>The studies in <a href="chapter3">chapter 3</a> contribute towards answering this question. On top of that, there is already much technical work towards decentralising the Social Web; in <a href="chapter4">chapter 4</a> I describe a specific subset of this, and in <a href="chapter5">chapter 5</a> I provide my own contributions to the field. Being directly involved in the technical work provides critical insight into the finer details of this question, from the 'other side' as it were, or the perspective of system creators rather than users who are at the heart of chapters 2 and 3.</p>

      <h3>Impact on practice</h3>
      <div>
        <p><strong>What can developers do to adapt to or accommodate self-presentation needs of individuals?</strong></p>

        <p>Finally, I want to offer something of use to the designers and developers of future social systems. I seed some answers this question in <a href="chapter5">chapter 5</a> in an exploratory manner which is neither exhaustive nor conclusive. Nonetheless, my hope is that this prompts future work, theoretical and practical, around novel ways for the Social Web to empower its participants.</p>

  <h2>Structure</h2>
  <div>

    <p>We begin with a literature survey of fundamental ideas from social sciences about the presentation of self, as well as more recent work from social and computer sciences, psychology, and media theory, about how people use such systems to express themselves and connect with others. Grounded in this, we discuss the current state of the art of social networking sites (SNSs); in particular how they fail to meet - or even violate - users' social needs, as indicated by the ways in which users bypass the various constraints imposed upon them.</p>

    <p>In chapter 3 we present five empirical studies which allow us to analyse different aspects of online identity behaviours 'in the wild', and further discuss the concept of an online profile as a tool for self expression. We conclude that what constitutes a suitable <em>profile</em> is context-dependent and varies with individual and community needs. We use the results of our studies to design a conceptual framework which assists in taking into account the multiple interacting <em>things</em> which must be considered when observing or designing online social systems.</p>

    <p>Chapter 4 takes a brief look at the history of implementation and standardisation efforts for decentralised online social interactions. We discuss these prior and ongoing efforts in the context of our conceptual framework.</p>

    <p>Chapter 5 summarises the work of the W3C Social Web Working Group, which took place during over two and a half years during the course of study for this thesis. ...</p>

  <h2>Methods and contributions</h2>
  <div>

    <p>The contributions of this thesis were generated by a combination of collation of existing academic work, empirical analyses, and practice through writing and implementing Web standards. <span class="note">todo: citation about emprical studies, and research by practice</span> </p>

    <p>The subject of empirical studies were users of social networking sites, participants in online communities, and those who otherwise engage in self-presentation through the Web. These observations led to the design of a conceptual framework which <del>makes it easier to think about all the really complicated things that affect each other all at once</del>. Miles and Huberman (1994) defined a conceptual framework as a visual or written product, that "explains, either graphically or in narrative form, the main things to be studied - the key factors, concepts, or variables - and the presumed relationships among them" (p. 18). Due to the complex nature of ...</p>

  <h2>Braindump</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Self presentation has evolved, with digital technologies, with the Web and personal publishing, an then with mainstream adoption of online social media. Where are we going next? One possibility is towards a world where we log and own vast amounts of data about ourselves. We choose to share - or not - the data as part of our identity; social disclosure; it contributes to our day-to-day personhood or sense of self. We imagine a world where the individual is empowered by their digital traces (not imprisoned), but this is a complex world.</p>
    <p>This thesis examines the many factors at play when we present ourselves through Web technologies. We optimistically look to a future where control over our digital identities are not in the hands of centralised actors, but our own, and survey the ongoing technical work which strives to make this a reality. Decentralisation changes things in unexpected ways. Iin the context of the bigger picture of our online selves, we examine what might change as we move towards decentralisation; how people could be affected, and what the possibilities are for a positive change. Finally we explore one possible way of self-presentation on a decentralised social web through lightweight controls which allow one's audience to set their expectations in order for you to meet them appropriately.</p>
    <p>We do not address privacy issues or means to protect one's online identity in the presence of malicious (centralised, powerful, state) actors. We do not address authentication or mechanisms for proving one's identity in a technical system.</p>
    <p>We acknowledge the multifaceted, complicated, messy, socially-shaped nature of the self. Technology is always going to fall short, but maybe we can make it not fall quite so short.</p>
