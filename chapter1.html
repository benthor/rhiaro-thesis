  <h2>Research questions</h2>
  <div>
    <p>The goal of this thesis is to bridge established social science research about self-presentation and impression management, with a practical, developer-centric perspective on building social web applications. We seek to understand how and why contemporary social networking systems both help and hinder individuals' expressive needs, and what people do to work around technical and social constraints they encounter during day to day use. What we learn from this, we can use to optimise future social systems for individual and collective empowerment.</p>

    <p>This work is best situated in the field of Web Science, a multidisciplinary domain with a focus on the relationships between people and the technology that connects them. We draw particularly upon related work in digital sociology as well as computer science […]</p>

    <p>Throughout this work we describe and advocate for particular visions of systems and technologies that we believe to be best practice, however it is important to note that such systems are not an end in themselves. The social changes that technologies enable are what matters. Thus we emphasise that while digital technology is constantly evolving, and subject to rapidly shifting political and technological landscapes […]peoples' needs and desires and perceived rights are also reconfigured by changing technology.</p>

  <h2>Structure</h2>
  <div>

    <p>We begin with a literature survey of fundamental ideas from social sciences about the presentation of self, as well as more recent work from social and computer sciences, psychology, and media theory, about how people use such systems to express themselves and connect with others. Grounded in this, we discuss the current state of the art of social networking sites (SNSs); in particular how they fail to meet - or even violate - users' social needs, as indicated by the ways in which users bypass the various constraints imposed upon them.</p>

    <p>In chapter 3 we present five empirical studies which allow us to analyse different aspects of online identity behaviours 'in the wild', and further discuss the concept of an online profile as a tool for self expression. We conclude that what constitutes a suitable <em>profile</em> is context-dependent and varies with individual and community needs. We use the results of our studies to design a conceptual framework which assists in taking into account the multiple interacting <em>things</em> which must be considered when observing or designing online social systems.</p>

    <p>Chapter 4 takes a brief look at the history of implementation and standardisation efforts for decentralised online social interactions. We discuss these prior and ongoing efforts in the context of our conceptual framework.</p>

    <p>Chapter 5 summarises the work of the W3C Social Web Working Group, which took place during over two and a half years during the course of study for this thesis. ...</p>

  <h2>Methods and contributions</h2>
  <div>

    <p>The contributions of this thesis were generated by a combination of collation of existing academic work, empirical analyses, and practice through writing and implementing Web standards. <span class="note">todo: citation about emprical studies, and research by practice</span> </p>

    <p>The subject of empirical studies were users of social networking sites, participants in online communities, and those who otherwise engage in self-presentation through the Web. These observations led to the design of a conceptual framework which <del>makes it easier to think about all the really complicated things that affect each other all at once</del>. Miles and Huberman (1994) defined a conceptual framework as a visual or written product, that "explains, either graphically or in narrative form, the main things to be studied - the key factors, concepts, or variables - and the presumed relationships among them" (p. 18). Due to the complex nature of ...</p>

  <h2>Braindump</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Self presentation has evolved, with digital technologies, with the Web and personal publishing, an then with mainstream adoption of online social media. Where are we going next? One possibility is towards a world where we log and own vast amounts of data about ourselves. We choose to share - or not - the data as part of our identity; social disclosure; it contributes to our day-to-day personhood or sense of self. We imagine a world where the individual is empowered by their digital traces (not imprisoned), but this is a complex world.</p>
    <p>This thesis examines the many factors at play when we present ourselves through Web technologies. We optimistically look to a future where control over our digital identities are not in the hands of centralised actors, but our own, and survey the ongoing technical work which strives to make this a reality. Decentralisation changes things in unexpected ways. Iin the context of the bigger picture of our online selves, we examine what might change as we move towards decentralisation; how people could be affected, and what the possibilities are for a positive change. Finally we explore one possible way of self-presentation on a decentralised social web through lightweight controls which allow one's audience to set their expectations in order for you to meet them appropriately.</p>
    <p>We do not address privacy issues or means to protect one's online identity in the presence of malicious (centralised, powerful, state) actors. We do not address authentication or mechanisms for proving one's identity in a technical system.</p>
    <p>We acknowledge the multifaceted, complicated, messy, socially-shaped nature of the self. Technology is always going to fall short, but maybe we can make it not fall quite so short.</p>
