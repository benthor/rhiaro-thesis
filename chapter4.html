<section id="introduction" rel="schema:hasPart">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div>
    <p>This chapter presents a survey of decentralised social systems: systems which store data about a person, their attributes and activities, and encourage sharing of this data and interactions with others in the network. These systems are analysed along various axes to determine their intended function, fitness for purpose and how they are or were ultimately used and to what extent. The core focus is on treatment of individuals as users of or participants in a system, and I classify systems according to their approach to handling user identities and profile data. I derive modules of decentralised social systems and the contexts in which they are likely to work well and benefit users; I also attempt to identify gaps and common pitfalls in existing theoretical and practical work.</p>
    <p>I finish by describing the most recent work (still ongoing at the time of writing) of the W3C Social Web Working Group, which is producing standards for decentralised social interactions on the Web.</p>

    <section id="scope" rel="schema:hasPart">
      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <div>
        <p>I would love for this chapter to be a complete history of decentralised social networks, but that would take many years to research and write. There exist many partial histories, glimpses into the past through the lens of some masters thesis or an ancient blog post found through archive.org by someone who was There At The Time. These people are even around today, and could be interviewed, if one was so inclined. Efforts towards decentralising social networks have been going on for as long as there have been social networks, and making use of a wide variety of different technologies, such as SMTP, XMPP, peer-to-peer architectures and the Blockchain. Many efforts in academic, commercial or FOSS environments are driven by producing secure private systems (ie. keeping messages transmitted over the network hidden from all but the sender and recipient), or by producing optimised, fast, highly scalable architectures.</p>
        <p>Given the topic of this thesis, I constrain the contents of this chapter in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>to systems on the Social <em>Web</em>; that is, which operate over HTTP, and</li>
          <li>to reports which center the 'user' as a human being, rather than a node; that is I will not cover projects which focus on a purely network architecture perspective.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="def-decentralisation" rel="schema:hasPart">
      <h3>Decentralisation</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Decentralisation is a fairly contentious term with different definitions or understandings depending on the background of the person talking about it. In this thesis, I use the definition from [<a href="#ref-halpin16">halpin16</a>]:</p>
        <blockquote><p>A system in which multiple authorities control different components and no single authority is fully trusted by all others. Decentralized systems are a subset of distributed systems.</p></blockquote>
        <p>This differentiates decentralised systems from <em>distributed</em> systems, which are not necessarily decentralised, in that the latter "may be managed by a single root of trust or authority."</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="def-social-systems" rel="schema:hasPart">
      <h3>Social systems</h3>
      <div>
        <p>I defined the type of social system I am interested in in Chapter 3, and repeat it here for convenience:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Social systems: </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Other concepts which will be useful throughout this chapter are:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt><p><strong>Protocol</strong></p></dt>
          <dd><p>A set of procedures according to which piece of software should be built.</p></dd>
          <dt><p><strong>Implementation</strong></p></dt>
          <dd><p>A piece of software, possibly designed according to a protocol.</p></dd>
          <dt><p><strong>Instance</strong></p></dt>
          <dd><p>An implementation which has been installed and is running somewhere, probably a server. One implementation can have many instances.</p></dd>
          <dt><p><strong>Federation</strong></p></dt>
          <dd><p>The joining together of software instances such that activities on one are seen on another (usually by means of a protocol).</p></dd>
        </dl>

    </section>

    <section id="selection" rel="schema:hasPart">
      <h3>Selection method</h3>
      <div>
        <p>There are numerous wiki pages and blog posts which list decentralised social systems<sup><a href="#fn-lists">lists</a></sup>, and academic literature reviews, and project reports which reference related work. I followed links to all projects listed (performing additional Web searches for information if necessary) and performed an exhaustive search on the literature through reading reference lists until I was no longer seeing new citations on the relevant topics. I excluded projects which are out of <a href="#scope">scope</a>; which are clearly abandoned (or have an unknown status) with no public information or documentation; which claim a desire to federate in the future but haven't actually achieved it; and projects which have pivoted in a different direction.</p>

        <p>There are a great deal of abandoned projects in this space, spanning more than a decade. It is my hope that one day I or someone else manages to locate their founders and conduct a more thorough post-mortem.</p>

        <p>I have, however, included projects which have wound down or are no longer actively maintained if they still provide documentation or blog posts about the work, and ideally running instances are still available, as these are still worthwhile to learn from. As a result, there may be some bias towards abandoned academic projects, since these are fairly well documented in peer-reviewed literature.</p>

  <h2>When is a person not a person?</h2>
  <div>

    <p>A: When they're a document. </p>

    <p>You have the infamous httpRange-14 issue to thank for this section title, which consists of a lengthy discussion (over a decade) and a resolution about how HTTP URIs can be used to represent both Web-based documents (information resources, IRs) which can be transported over HTTP, and everything else (non-information resources, NIRs, like people and places) which, needless to say, cannot be transported over HTTP (yet). In some systems, this distinction matters, and so these systems separate <em>people</em> from the <em>documents about</em> them by using fragment URIs (fragments aren't passed to servers, so they server can only return the resource represented by the URI up to and not including the fragment) and 301 redirects (the server says "sorry this URI identifies a NIR which I can't return, so I have to send you to an IR about it instead").</p>

    <p>Open data models for representing people and their activities within social networks have been created over the years independently of software implementations that use them, and are sometimes picked up by separate projects. The following may be referred to as in-use by other protocols or implementations throughout the remainder of this chapter:</p>

  <h2>Social (and) personal datastores</h2>
  <div>
    <p>The data stored may be distinctly personal, shared with third-parties only in specific contexts for a particular purpose; or it may be inherantly social, expected to be broadcast on creation to at least one other person and possibly subject to further reshaping, sharing, and propagation throughout a network of people. Many datastores are optimised for one or the other of these scenarios and may place constraints on their users accordingly; others attempt to meet requirements for both types of data and encounter different implementation and usability challenges as a result.</p>

<section id="from-status-updates-to-microblogging-and-beyond" rel="schema:hasPart">
  <h2>From status updates to microblogging, and beyond</h2>
  <div>
    <p>There was some point when everyone (planning/discussing decentralised systems) was referring to ‘status updates’ and I think twitter maybe switched the terminology to ‘microblogging’ but now, with AS2 and stuff, I feel like all content is being modelled equally and there’s less trying to enumerate all types of content, and awareness of a need for extensibility. This is pertinent to the idea that a stream of content contributes just as much to a person’s online presentation as a set of attributes. Status updates were kind of ‘my current state’ which is distinctly something at the top of a profile, like ‘about me right now’, but microblogging keeps a feed of past states very visible as well.</p>

<section id="standards-and-monocultures" rel="schema:hasPart">
  <h2>Standards and monocultures</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Some projects publish the specifications of their systems as protocols that anyone can implement. ...</p>

    <p>Implementations may be assembled from an existing set of more modular protocols. In some cases, existing sets of protocols have been identified and documented as complimentary. One example is OStatus, which combines Atom, ActivityStreams, PubSubHubbub, Salmon and Webfinger. Another is Solid, which uses LDP, WebID+TLS, FOAF and Web Access Control; DSSN uses WebID, FOAF, Semantic Pingback and PubSubHubbub. OStatus has several independent implementations listed on its Wikipedia page at the time of writing, including GNU Social (previously StatusNet) and Mastodon, both of which there are hundreds of instances.</p>

    <p>Indiewebby protocols, but see more in SWWG section for these.</p>

    <p>Projects which publish their protocols and state their intent to have independent implementations but in practice have limited implementations include Tent and RemoteStorage.</p>

    <p>Zot! supercedes DFRN, both by Friendca. RedMatrix?.</p>

    <p>Conversely, some projects cultivate monocultures, either by not publishing their protocols at all or by gaining little adoption outside of a single core implementation. In computing, a monoculture is when a group of computers all run the same software. Several FOSS Social Web projects meet this description, with large and active developer communities who all contribute to the same codebase (Pump.io, BuddyCloud, ownCloud ..). That particular piece of software is expected to be downloaded and installed on multiple different servers, and different instances can interoperate with each other so it runs in a decentralised manner. This has the advantage that, assuming a straightforward setup process, new instances can be set up quickly and easily, aiding adoption. However, a security vulnerability in the core code base would be present across all instances; there is overhead for developers working on the project to agree its direction and realisation; and focusing on this type of architecture can mean that optimisations for same-software interoperability come at the expense of potentially more open protocols, as is the case with diaspora*. Monocultures can emerge when one implementation of an open protocol is particularly successful; an example is Known, which implements Micropub and Webmention but also has a for-profit company behind it which has driven wide adoption through managed and white-labelled instances for educational institutions.</p>

<section id="apps" rel="schema:hasPart">
  <h2>If the app fits</h2>
  <div>
    <p>A common focus of decentralised Social Web projects is decoupling application logic from data storage. Whilst most of the protocols have client-to-server APIs which would technically allow this architecture (like Pump.io), they don't necessarily focus on it as a strength.  Solid, Unhosted, Hood.ie, Tent.</p>

  <h2>The Social Web Working Group</h2>
  <div>

    <p>Ultimately, the Social Web Working Group has produced the following recommendations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>ActivityStreams 2.0 Core and Vocabulary</strong>: A JSON data model and syntax for social content and interactions, with extensibility based on JSON-LD.</li>
      <li><strong>ActivityPub</strong>: An API for creating content, delivering notifications, and managing common side-effects of interactions within social networks, based on ActivityStreams 2.0.</li>
      <li><strong>Linked Data Notifications</strong>: An API for delivering and reusing generic notifications, based on JSON-LD.</li>
      <li><strong>Micropub</strong>: An API for creating content, based on microformats2.</li>
      <li><strong>Webmention</strong>: An API for delivering notifications when a resource on the Web refers to the URL of another.</li>
      <li><strong>WebSub</strong>: An API for managing and fulfilling subscription requests to Web content (formally known as PubSubHubbub).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And the following Working Group notes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>JF2</strong>: An alternative JSON syntax and vocabulary for representing social objects, based on microformats2.</li>
      <li><strong>Post-type Discovery</strong>: An algorithm for converting between implicitly typed social objects (like JF2) to explicitly typed ones (like ActivityStreams 2.0).</li>
      <li><strong>Social Web Protocols</strong>: A guide to the specifications produced by the group, including how they overlap or complement each other.</li>

      <h3>Implementations</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Each of the recommendations has received a number of implementations during the Working Group's lifetime. Some were formally submitted to the Working Group as implementation reports whilst the specifications were undergoing review. This section surveys and briefly describes the implementations to date, and notes relationships to work previously described in this chapter where applicable.</p>
