  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Many of the systems discussed in the previous chapter have proven foundational for ongoing efforts to create standards for decentralised social interactions on the Web. Previously we gave an overview of the standards being produced by the W3C Social Web Working Group; now we discuss in more depth notable decisions and debates of the group, describe the resulting standards in more detail, and outline how to actually go about building decentralised social systems which empower self-presentation using these standards. The contributions of this chapter are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A critical analysis of contemporary standards for decentralised social interaction on the Web, taking into account social dynamics of collaborative projects and the W3C consensus model, as well as the technical considerations.</li>
      <li>A characterisation of the problems being solved by the Social Web WG, and how these relate to the more specific problem of online self-presentation, by means of the conceptual framework from chapter 3.</li>
      <li>A technical primer for the work produced by the group (published by the W3C as a Working Group Note: <em>Social Web Protocols</em>).</li>
      <li>Prototype implementations of standards produced by the group, and a report on their interoperability with implementations produced by others.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This chapter brings together the qualitative research from earlier with concrete technical outcomes in the form of protocol designs. The work of the Social Web Working Group is in effect a case study for designing decentralised Social Web systems, but what is presented here is more than a survey or observational study. Since I was first a member of the Working Group, and then the W3C Team Contact, I was immersed in every part of the decision making and contributed in some form to all of the specifications produced. The <em>Social Web Protocols</em> document contributes a deeper understanding of the various protocols, and importantly how they can complement or contradict each other. This document is particularly useful <em>because</em> of the complicated social dynamics of the group, and produced as an introductory piece for developers entering this space anew. Technical decisions that have been made by the Working Group over the past (almost) three years were not made in a vacuum, nor dictated by cold logic, but rarely backed up with truly meaningful data. Most decisions were made on - admittedly well-honed - gut instinct of experts, data from small samples, and anecdotal evidence. <em>Social Web Protocols</em> contains fine technical details of the Working Group's recommendations, which are crucial for a complete picture and analysis of the current cutting-edge of decentralised Social Web standards.</p>

  <h2>Standards and self-presentation</h2>
  <div>
    <p>We have previously established that (obviously?) online self-presentation is greatly more complex than listing attributes and a photo on a Web page. For decentralised systems to emulate the multitude of self-presentation possibilities provided by mainstream centralised systems today they must coordinate across a range of potential user activities and interactions. Common protocols enable disparate systems to communicate without any prior arrangements. Specifications describing such protocols must be agreed upon and published in such a way that makes them easy to find, and appear authoritative enough that developers of decentralised systems are convinced to implement them.</p>

    <p>This section documents and furthers that process, as part of the work of the W3C Social Web Working Group.</p>

      <h3>API Requirements</h3>
      <div>
        <p>An early activity of the Working Group was to write 99 "user stories" describing actions that people should be able to carry out using systems based on standards produced by the group. The goal of this was to focus efforts on the most important standards to be worked on, to meet the needs that appeared most critical to members of the group. Most group members contributed one or more user stories, and they varied based on the perspective of the individual or organisation they represented. The group then voted (+1, .....) on every user story, and selected a top eight to prioritise.</p>

        <p>My subsequent contribution was to derive API requirements from the shortlisted user stories.</p>

        <p class="todo">How the standards of the SWWG can fit together into an actual system: <a href="https://w3.org/TR/social-web-protocols">SWP</a></p>
        <p>This section introduces the <em>Social Web Protocols</em>, a description of the specifications produced by the Social Web Working Group as arranged by the previously derived API requirements. Some content in this section is published as a W3C Working Group Note [<a href="#ref-swp">swp</a>]. Systems can be built with these protocols in great variety. Incorporating the standards produced by the Social Web Working Group does not automatically mean a system is empowering to its users as the protocols provide only a skeleton, leaving much open for specialisation by developers. Conformance to these protocols does however imply that users are able to move their data between systems; that clients and servers are somewhat decoupled so users have more flexibility with regards to tools; and that users are not compelled to follow their network or locked into the system where their friends are.</p>

        <section id="swp-overview" rel="schema:hasPart">
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <div>

            <p>People and the content they create are the core components of the Social Web; they make up the social graph. This document describes a standard way in which people can:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>connect with other people and subscribe to their content;</li>
              <li>create, update and delete social content;</li>
              <li>interact with other peoples' content;</li>
              <li>be notified when other people interact with their content;</li>
            </ul>

            <p>regardless of <em>what that content</em> is or <em>where it is stored</em>.</p>

            <p>These components are core building blocks for interoperable social systems.</p>

            <p>Each of these components can be implemented independently as needed, or all together in one system, as well as extended to meet domain-specific requirements. Users can store their social data across any number of compliant servers, and use compliant clients hosted elsewhere to interact with their own content and the content of others. Put simply, this document tells you, according the recommendations of the Social Web Working Group:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>how to expose/consume social content (reading).</li>
              <li>what to post, and where to, in order to create, update or delete content (publishing).</li>
              <li>how to ask for notifications about content (subscribing).</li>
              <li>how to deliver notifications about content or users (delivery).</li>
              <!-- <li>how to expose profiles and <a href="#relationships">relationships</a>.</li> -->
            </ul>

            <p>The <a href="#swp-reqs">following table</a> shows the high level requirements according to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/socialweb/social-wg-charter.html">Social Web Working Group charter</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/Social_API/Requirements">Social API Requirements</a>, and how the specifications of the Working Group overlap with respect to each.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>ActivityPub and ActivityStreams 2.0</strong>: ActivityPub uses the AS2 syntax and vocabulary for the payload of all requests.</li>
              <li><strong>ActivityPub and Linked Data Notifications</strong>: ActivityPub specialises LDN as the mechanism for delivery of notifications by requiring that payloads are AS2. <em>Inbox</em> endpoint discovery is the same. LDN receivers can understand requests from ActivityPub federated servers, but ActivityPub servers can't necessarily understand requests from generic LDN senders.</li>
              <li><strong>ActivityStreams 2.0 and Linked Data Notifications</strong>: LDN MAY use the AS2 syntax and vocabulary for the payload of notification requests.</li>
              <li><strong>Webmention and Linked Data Notifications</strong>: Overlapping functionality that needs to be bridged due to different content types of requests. An LDN request MAY contain the equivalent data as a Webmention request, but not necessarily vice versa.</li>
              <li><strong>ActivityPub and Micropub</strong>: Overlapping functionality that needs to be bridged due to different vocabularies and possibly different content types of requests. Micropub specifies client-to-server interactions for content creation; ActivityPub specifies this, <em>plus</em> side-effects and server-to-server interactions.</li>
              <li><strong>Micropub and Webmention</strong>: Are complementary but independent. Content could be created with Micropub, then Webmention discovery can be commenced on any URLs in the content.</li>
              <li><strong>Micropub and Linked Data Notifications</strong>: Are complementary but independent. Content could be created with Micropub, then LDN discovery can be commenced on any relevant resources identified by the server.</li>
              <li><strong>Micropub and WebSub</strong>: Are complementary but independent. Content could be created with Micropub, then passed to a WebSub <em>hub</em> for delivery to subscribers.</li>

          <div>
            <p>An individual's self presentation online can be partially composed of content they produce and interact with. The <em>read</em> label covers how these are exposed for consumption by others. This may include permissions or access control, which could require the reader to identify themselves before content is made available. Different types of content and interactions should be discoverable, perhaps according to criteria like the type of content, a group or individual with which it is associated, or through its association with other content (eg. through replies).</p>

            <h5 id="content-representation">Content representation</h5>

            <p><strong>ActivityStreams 2.0</strong> (AS2) models content and interactions as objects and activities. AS2 includes a <em>vocabulary</em> for modelling different types of objects and activities as well as various relations they might have with other objects (including user profiles) and activities. The AS2 <em>syntax</em> describes a consistent structure for objects and activities including sets of objects and activities as collections. Collections can be explicitly created and updated by a user (like adding photos to an album) or generated automatically as a result of other user actions or the properties of certain objects/activities (eg. a list of followers of a user). AS2 does not specify how objects, activities, or collections come into existence, only what they look like once they do.</p>

            <p>AS2 content must be served with the Content-Type <code>application/activity+json</code> or, if necessary for JSON-LD extended implementations, <code>application/ld+json; profile="http://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams"</code>. Content must be described using the AS2 vocabulary, and may use other vocabularies in addition or instead, per the extension mechanism.</p>

            <p>To make content available as ActivityStreams 2.0 JSON, one could do so directly when requested with an appropriate <code>Accept</code> header (eg. <code>application/activity+json</code> or <code>application/ld+json</code>), or indirectly via a <code>rel="alternate" type="application/activity+json"</code> link . This link could be to a different domain, for third-party services which dynamically generate ActivityStreams 2.0 JSON on behalf of a publisher.</p>

            <p>AS2 builds upon ActivityStreams 1.0 [<a href="#ref-as1">as1</a>] and is not fully backwards compatible; <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core#activitystreams-1.0">the relationship between AS1 and AS2 is documented in the AS2 spec</a>.</p>

            <p>Because AS2 is a data model, it does not recommend how data should be displayed. Its utility is in enabling a consistent representation of social objects and activities to be passed between potentially disconnected systems (eg. from Alice's social network to Bob's). The systems consuming the data are responsible for rendering it appropriately. This means that system designers can provide their users with options for customising the presentation data that may constitute their profiles.</p>

            <h5 id="extending-as2">Extending AS2</h5>

            <p>AS2 specifies a finite set of object and activity types and properties. These are a baseline set of common social interactions which can be extended upon by systems which need additional terms or more specific variations. The extension mechanism is based on linked data, via JSON-LD. Developers are expected to publish documentation and an RDF representation of their terms at a domain under their control, and refer to terms by URI in the normal manner. Further, the Social Web Working Group describes a mechanism by which well-used extensions are included with the AS2 namespace document by means of a W3C Community Group vetting process. The advantage of this is that implementations can adopt common extensions easily, without needing to include additional namespaces. It also makes extensions more discoverable for newcomers to AS2.</p>

            <p>The first such extension is in fact <strong>ActivityPub</strong>. ActivityPub uses ActivityStreams 2.0 for all data in all requests, and also adds additional terms to the AS2 namespace. Thus, ActivityPub requires requests have the Content-Type <code>application/ld+json; profile="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams"</code>.</p>

            <h5 id="content-representation-other">Other ways of representing content</h5>

            <p>Despite AS2 being the recommended synatax and vocabulary of the Working Group, some specifications use different or broader mechanisms. This helps to let developers pick and choose different specifications for different tasks even if they prefer not to use AS2:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Linked Data Notifications</strong> notification contents can use any vocabulary, so long as the data is available in JSON-LD. Thus notifications may use ActivityStreams 2.0, but don't have to. Clients and servers can negotiate between themselves (using <code>Accept</code> and <code>Accept-Post</code> HTTP headers) about using different RDF syntaxes, as well.</li>
              <li><strong>Micropub</strong> clients which expect to read data (this would usually be clients for <em>updating</em> content) are expecting it as JSON in the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2-parsing">parsed microformats2 syntax</a>.</li>
              <li><strong>WebSub</strong> is agnostic as to the Content-Type used by publishers; hubs are expected to deliver the new content to subscribers as-is produced by the publisher, at the publisher's <code>topic</code> URL.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5 id="objects-and-streams">Objects and streams</h5>

            <p>Whichever syntax and vocabulary is used, there are some general recommendations for representing objects (individual entities) and streams (sets or collections of objects).</p>
            <ul>
              <li>All objects must have URLs in their <code>id</code> property. This URL should resolve to return the properties of an object; what is returned may depend on the requester's right to access the content, determined by authentication and/or authorisation.</li>
              <li>Each stream must have a URL, which must resolve to return the contents of the stream (according to the requester's right to access, and could be paged). The data returned may include additional metadata about the stream (such as title, description).</li>
              <li>Each object in a stream must contain at least its URL, which can be dereferenced to retrieve all properties of the object, and may contain other properties of the object.</li>
              <li>One user may publish one or more streams of content. Streams may be generated automatically or manually, and might be segregated by post type, topic, audience, or any arbitrary criteria decided by the curator of the stream. A user <a href="#profiles">profile</a> MAY include links to multiple streams, which a consumer could follow to read or subscribe to.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5 id="special-streams">Special streams</h5>

            <p>Streams are represented in AS2 as a <code>Collection</code> or <code>OrderedCollection</code>. ActivityPub defines some special usages; two streams that must be accessible from a user's profile, and four which are optional, via the following properties:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><code>inbox</code>: A reference to an AS2 collection comprising all the objects sent to the profile's owner.</li>
              <li><code>outbox</code>: An AS2 collection comprising all the objects produced by the profile's owner.</li>
              <li><code>following</code>: An optional AS2 collection of the users that this user is following.</li>
              <li><code>followers</code>: An optional AS2 collection of the users that follow this user.</li>
              <li><code>likes</code>: An optional AS2 collection of every <code>object</code> from all of the user's <code>Like</code> activities (generated automatically by the server).</li>
              <li><code>streams</code>: An optional list of supplementary AS2 collections which may be of interest. </li>
            </ul>
  
            <p>ActivityPub permits arbitrary streams to be updated through specifying special behavior for the server when it receives activities with types <code>Add</code> and <code>Remove</code>. When a server receives such an activity in the <code>outbox</code>, and the <code>target</code> is a stream, it must add the <code>object</code> to the <code>target</code> (for <code>Add</code>) or remove the <code>object</code> from the <code>target</code> (for <code>Remove</code>).</p>

            <p>Two kinds of special streams are <code>inbox</code> and <code>outbox</code>. When read (ie. with an HTTP <code>GET</code> request) they return ordinary streams of objects, but they also double as endpoints which can be <code>POST</code>ed to directly to add objects, for <a href="#swp-delivery">delivery of notifications</a> and <a href="#swp-publish">publishing new content</a> respectively.</p>

            <p>The <code>inbox</code> is a notion shared by ActivityPub and Linked Data Notifications, however in order to be <em>read</em> by both ActivityPub <em>and</em> LDN clients, publishers must relate the stream to the objects it contains using both the <code>as:items</code> and <code>ldp:contains</code> predicates. This is an unfortunate discord, but since ActivityPub is immovably tied to AS2 and LDN is immovably tied to compatibility with existing Linked Data Platform servers, there was really no compromise to be had. Fortunately this bridge is relatively minor in terms of coding, once a developer is aware of it.</p>

          <p>Studying communities through passive and active digital traces, as Web Observatories are designed to do [<a href="#webobs">9</a>, <a href="#websciobs">26</a>], brings with it a host of privacy, ethical, and methodological concerns. Attempts to address online privacy issues in general are being made with a push towards <em>re-decentralising</em> the Web [<a href="#dcent">8</a>], in part through open Web standards and work on promoting personal data stores as alternatives to centralised or third-party services. Using this momentum can benefit the Web Science community as well as their observees (though it brings with it its own set of challenges). Decentralisation is applied to Web Observatories in particular through the idea of a <em>Personal Web Observatory</em> [<a href="#vk14">11</a>] as a user-controlled (as opposed to third-party imposed) means of collecting and tracking data.</p> 
          <!-- <p>Even assuming uptake of decentralised technologies for online activities...</p> -->
          <!-- <p>This article builds on the idea of  , through iteratively developing <em>and using</em> one such system over a year.</p> -->
          <!-- <p>Experimenting with new standards for decentralised online social activities has given rise to the development of my personal website into a system that fits the description of a <em>Personal Web Observatory</em> [<a href="#vk14">11</a>].</p> -->
          <p>I believe that the perspectives of both subject and experimenter are valuable when it comes to studying people in new ways. Taking inspiration from the reflective practices of the Quantified Self community, I progressively built features into my own personal website which allow monitoring and visualisation of day-to-day aspects of my life, and used it continuously for the period of one year. Immersion in the ongoing effects of self-tracking in a decentralised manner led to greater insight in working towards Personal Web Observatories than either developing a personal data store or engaging in self-tracking through third-party services could do alone.</p>

          <p>This article begins by outlining related work on Web Observatories, Quantified Self, and the decentralised Social Web. It includes a summary of the architecture of the personal data store being studied, and the types of data collected. I discuss the results in terms of psychological impact of the experiment, evolving motivations, and expected and unexpected consequences. In conclusion I relate these results to new and existing challenges for Web Observatories and Web Scienctists who want to study data generated by Personal Web Observatories or similarly decentralised systems.</p>

                    <p>Web Observatories concern the use of peoples' digital footprints as the subject of academic inquiry [<a href="#webobs">9</a>, <a href="#websciobs">26</a>]. Such data encompasses all manner of online and offline activities, and it may be collected passively by systems with which individuals interact, or actively logged, or some combination of the two. In order to address negative privacy implications of collecting and analysing this data, [<a href="#vk14">11</a>] introduces the idea of a <em>Personal Web Observatory</em>. Personal data stores are presented as an architecture for a decentralised Web Observatory, to allow individuals to maintain control over their data whilst still participating in scientific studies or otherwise releasing their data for use by third parties.</p>
                    <p>A Personal Web Observatory relies on individuals opting in to self-tracking activities; connecting their personal data store to sensors or user interfaces.</p>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="as:content">
                    <p>There have been a small number of high profile instances of individuals collecting a large volume of data about themselves, then offering it up for auction [<a href="#slate">5</a>, <a href="#wired">20</a>]. Even more common are those who track data about themselves in order to: orchestrate behavioural changes; monitor bodily functions; learn new things about themselves; discern cause-and-effect relations; aid memory; manage information and life events; make better decisions; or just for the fun of it (for surveys of self-tracking motivations and tools, see [<a href="#reflect">12</a>, <a href="#sleep">2</a>, <a href="#motivations">7</a>, <a href="#bigdata">23</a>]). This personal self-tracking is disruptive to traditional notions of big data and data science [<a href="#bigdata">23</a>].</p>
                    <p>The Quantified Self (QS) community is large, global, and growing. In-person conferences and meetups are held regularly [<a href="#darkside">14</a>, <a href="#eleven">15</a>]. Whilst they use a wide range and combination of DIY and off-the-shelf devices for self-tracking [<a href="#eleven">15</a>, <a href="#swan12">21</a>], what is particularly interesting are their reflective practices.
                    QS practitioners engage in creative ways to collect, visualise, and understand data about themselves. At meetups, talks are focussed around deep personal insights, optimisation and improvement, and active self-awareness, rather than technology or tools [<a href="#sleep">2</a>, <a href="#swan12">21</a>, <a href="#eleven">15</a>].</p>
                    <p>However, the psychological impact of quantifying day-to-day activities is more complex than detecting trends and setting goals. Self-tracking may work against our best interests as interpretation of data is both subjective, and prone to <em>re-interpretation</em> at each viewing. There is also evidence that attempting to enforce a particular behaviour can have the opposite effect. Peoples' memories and impressions are easily influenced by external and internal factors [<a href="#irony">3</a>]. A participant in [<a href="#reflect">12</a>] expressed concern about becoming "compulsive" about data collection, and [<a href="#reflect">12</a>] also describes how many off-the-shelf self-tracking services do not provide adequate means to aid user reflection.</p>
                    <p>Another negative effect of QS tracking is poor security of sensor software and third-party storage which can compromise individuals' data [<a href="#symantec">1</a>]. Plus, using third-party software typically comes with terms of service which are problematic from a privacy perspective.</p>
                    <p>Quantified self tracking is gamification of non-play activities, and [<a href="#gaming">28</a>] describes gamification as having surveillance at its root. [<a href="#gaming">28</a>] emphasises that quantification is a tool for governance and control and [<a href="#eleven">15</a>] concurs that statistics are historically used to manage populations, and this form of control is internalised by individuals for management of self. Prevalence of QS devices and habits can serve to normalise surveillance. Further, QS tracking in the workplace is being introduced in ways that are becoming increasingly difficult to opt-out of, and raises unrealistic expectations of workers "fostered by a quantified, machine-like image of human productivity" [<a href="#moore16">13</a>].</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, [<a href="#eleven">15</a>] describes QS participants who pushing back against the expectations and categories of the companies whose devices they use with their own interpretations of their data, "calling into question who gets to do the aggregation and how".</p>
                    <!--<p>TODO: There are lots of platforms to aggregate QS data from different devices. What's the difference between this and PWOs?</p>-->

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="as:content">

                    <p>Though most bloggers and social media users do not explicitly set out to log small events in their lives, other kinds of social publishing can also be considered a form of self-tracking. Indeed, it is these types of data which Web Observatories today are most commonly consuming and analysing. Blogs have been around since the early days of the Web, initially for collecting links and then for documenting ideas and experiences. More recently, such expressions are commonly published to centralised social networking site, and many systems facilitate deeper data logging than just prose content. For example, the Facebook 'status update' input presents preset options for mood, location, films, books, friends, and other activities. These are easily attached to a text post through a seamless user interface, where the <em>intent</em> feels quite different to services and devices specifically marketed for self-tracking, but the end result in terms of data collected is largely the same.</p>

                    <!-- <p>TODO: whip round of attitudes towards social media, and self-cite deception stuff.</p> -->

                    <p>While there are various efforts to address <em>decentralisation</em> of the Social Web [<a href="#dcent">8</a>], of particular note are ongoing formal standardisation efforts at the W3C. The W3C Social Web and Web Annotations Working Groups are developing standards for not only publishing content, but interacting with content in the same manner as one would through centralised social networking sites. Unlike centralised systems, instead of coordination between common technology stacks or shared access to databases, they use mutually implemented communication protocols. The ActivityStreams 2.0 (AS2) [<a href="#as2">19</a>] specification provides a syntax and vocabulary for types of data commonly found on the Social Web, as well as an extension mechanism for adding new types of activities and objects. ActivityPub [<a href="#ap">24</a>], Micropub [<a href="#mp">16</a>] and the Web Annotations Protocol [<a href="#wap">18</a>] define protocols for publishing which facilitate decentralision by decoupling clients from the servers which store the data. Linked Data Notifications (LDN) [<a href="#ldn">4</a>], Webmention [<a href="#wm">17</a>], and WebSub [<a href="#websub">6</a>] provide mechanisms for propagating social interactions and other data between otherwise unrelated servers.</p>

        <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:abstract as:content">
            <p>In this section I describe my Personal Web Observatory setup. One notable constraint from the outset was that in order to minimise maintenance requirements the system needed to be no more complicated to run than a personal website. As such it is implemented in PHP and runs on standard shared Web hosting, with a MySQL backend.</p>

            <section id="architecture" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#architecture">
                <h4 property="as:name">Architecture</h4>
                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="as:content">

                    <p>The system (which is named <em><a href="https://rhiaro.co.uk/sloph">sloph</a></em>) constitutes a central database which is an RDF quadstore (layered on top of a MySQL database by the ARC2 PHP library). Using a graph data model facilitates the addition of new data without the overhead of updating schema or models in the core code.</p>

                    <p>For incoming data, it uses two endpoints: <em>publication</em> and <em>notification</em>, which implement the server portions of ActivityPub and LDN respectively. To compensate for overlapping standards, the publication endpoint additionally includes bridging code which converts Micropub requests in ActivityPub requests before proceeding, and the notification endpoint converts Webmentions into <abbr title="Linked Data Notifications">LDN</abbr>. Data is processed to examine its validity, and stored as-is in the quad store. Publication data all uses the AS2 syntax and vocabulary (or extensions thereof), and notification data is stored using whatever vocabulary is sent by the notifying party. Data from each endpoint are stored in different graphs in the quad store to manage provenance.</p>

                    <p>The notifications endpoint can receive unsolicted messages from any LDN Sender, which may be somebody else's personal data store, or a clientside tool. In addition, some third-party services have been configured to send notifications to the notification endpoint. <a href="https://webmention.io">Webmention.io</a> and <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> have webhook settings, which are set to the notifications endpoint. They forward JSON data, which is easily convertible into JSON-LD, used by the LDN standard. <a href="https://brid.gy">Brid.gy</a> is a service which runs in the background and monitors my social media profiles for replies to my posts, then sends these as Webmention notifications. Upon certain new incoming notifications, the endpoint sends a request to the <em><a href="https://pushover.net/">PushOver</a></em> API, which sends a push notification to my Android phone.</p>

                    <p>Data may be retrieved as individual items (AS2 <em>Objects</em> or <em>Activities</em>), or in sets (AS2 <em>Collections</em>); all are identified by URLs. Content negotiation is employed so that requesting clients may access the data in any desired RDF syntax, or HTML. For HTML display, simple templates are created for each 'type' (or shared between a set of similar types) of data item. It is expected that most requests come from Web browsers, so the HTML content is delivered most often. However, other applications or services may consume the data, including readers (which may mix together multiple streams of data for the user), aggregators (which read the data and perform some manipulation or calculation over it to display the results) or publishing clients (which offer editing or combining of existing data). All data is public; I did not implement access control.</p>

                    <p>The publication endpoint performs additional functions for data enhancement and distribution. It automatically adds missing metadata to posts if necessary (for example, published date and author), as well as storing new relations between posts and relevant collections such as tags, as well as the specific collections required by ActivityPub. The publication endpoint forwards text posts to Twitter, if necessary truncating them and adding a link back to the original, which helps with reach of content (since I don't yet have a subscription mechanism implemented). The publication endpoint also scans the content and certain attributes of incoming data for URLs, and behaves as an LDN and Webmention Sender to deliver notifications to others, if possible.</p>

                    <p>[<a href="#vk14">11</a>] suggests that the first feature of a <abbr title="Personal Web Observatory">PWO</abbr> should be to allow individuals to consolidate data collected by third parties into one repository under their control. Rather than attempting to aggregate - or even find - <em>all</em> data about myself spread across the Web, I chose a handful of services which have particular value to me, that I have been using to actively log particular things. I exported data from <a href="https://last.fm">Lastfm</a> (over ten years of music listening history), <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> (7 years of short notes), <a href="https://runkeeper.com">Runkeeper</a> (1 year of runs, walks and hikes with GPS traces), and <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.com">Bitbucket</a> (5 years of code commit history), and Firefox bookmarks (2 years). I also exported data from 750words.com (almost 7 years of intermittent use) but did not import this into my store due to private content and no reliable access control built in.</p>

                    <p>Templates were created not all at once, but as I decided to start tracking something new and wanted to visualise it. Templates were continually modified and improved over the course of the year.</p>

                    <p>At the time of writing, I display posts in three different formats on my homepage (<a href="#screenshot">figure 2</a>): a feed of the most recent eight article and note posts displayed in full; a list of the most recent of each type of post, displayed as a sentence (eg. "the last thing I ate was toast with peanut butter, 25 minutes ago"); and the last 1600 posts of all kinds, visualised as a string of small coloured boxes with icons. The colours represent where I was at the time of making the post (according to the most recent prior 'vague' checkin) and the icons indicate the type of post. Clicking on any of these boxes takes you to the post itself. In addition, the background colour of the homepage changes according to where I am at the present time. I also show my top 128 tags, and the number of posts for each.</p>

                    <p>Another type of output is a <a href="https://rhiaro.co.uk/summary">/summary</a> page, which aggregates data between any two dates, defaulting to the past seven days. This is useful for producing a year- and week-in-review, and includes total amount of money spent, top foods eaten, number of words written, and various averages.</p>

Unfortunately, for the sources of data exported from other services mentioned previously, I did not (yet) implement a connection to their various APIs to post subsequent data directly to my site.</p> 

                    <p>As I decided to log a new kind of data, I either created or sought out a suitable client. As an intermediary measure (eg. while a client was in development), I could insert data into the quadstore directly using my SPARQL endpoint, which turns out to be a pretty useful bootstrapping measure. Clients I developed myself are simple web forms, which post AS2 data as JSON-LD to my publication endpoint.</p>

                    <p>I typically logged data at the time of its occurrence if possible. If I didn't have an internet connection (a frequent occurrence whilst traveling) I used a local 'timestamp' Android app to record the time and note crucial details, then back-dated posts at the earliest opportunity.</p>

                    <p>[<a href="#vk14">11</a>] proposes that "small data analytics, while sparse, could be made statistically viable when gathered longitudinally over time." Whilst I haven't done any complex statistical analysis on my data, certainly aggregated results, counts, and some calculations of means have been personally insightful. To take some trivial examples: that I drank on average 0.8 cups of coffee per day in 2016 was lower than I expected; that I spent an average of $28.71 per day was higher than I expected; and that I spent 1 month, 15 days, 6 hours, 41 minutes, and 15 seconds travelling between places is just kind of interesting (and something I particularly wanted to find out when I started recording 'vague' checkins). I don't expect these statistics to be remotely captivating for anyone else; such is the value of personal "small data."</p>

                    <p>Such aggregations were able to be put to more focused uses. Logging all of my purchases did not raise my internal awareness of how much I was spending on a weekly or monthly basis, but when I realised I wasn't saving money after about six months it was trival to write a small web app which consumed my data stream, aggregated the total cost by certain categories, and displayed the amount I spent in any given month or week. Adding a setting for a monthly budget goal let the app send me notifications to stop spending when it noticed I was on track to exceed this in the current week. The app is not coupled to my personal site or data, so it can be used by anyone who publishes a stream of their purchases using AS2.</p>

                    <p>An initial motivation of recording 'vague' checkins was so people could check my site to see whether I was on my way if we were planning to meet, or if I shouldn't be disturbed (eg. if I was in a meeting). Industrious computer science friends created an IRC bot that consumed my <a href="https://rhiaro.co.uk/where">/where</a> endpoint and responded when asked <code>$whereis rhiaro</code>. Other users of the same IRC channel added their own location reporting endpoints for the bot to read, some down to GPS accuracy with a map, shortly thereafter. Other unanticipated uses of data I was recording include launching a travel blog which filtered travel-related posts and photos from my main feed, and a food blog which includes my food logs, food-related photos, and any posts or bookmarks about recipes or restaurant reviews. </p>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="as:content">

                    <p>Having visible output for each log on my website motivated me to keep logging. I am missing lots of checkins to specific cities because I had trouble with a maps API and didn't complete the template to display them. Similarly I never got around to creating a compelling view of sleep records, so logs for those are few and far between.</p>

                    <p>I felt an internal pressure to ensure my data stream was complete. If I was offline or out of battery for a length of time, I would keep logs on paper to back-date later. This was due both to wanting to ensure aggregate data was accurate, and fear of 'losing' associated memories. Relatedly, I looked (and in fact still do) through historical logs with surprising frequency, and found memories of events, people and places were triggered by descriptions of meals or photos of purchases that I might otherwise have forgotten. I worry that this is unhealthy, boarding on obsessive behaviour though. At times, particularly before I had a streamlined offline-logging plan in place, or if it was socially inappropriate to be writing or typing logs, I felt <em>anxious</em> that I would neglect to log something.</p>

                    <p>When my webhost experienced outages, leaving me unable to record data, I both noticed far more quickly and felt a far stronger personal impact than I previously would have when my site was mostly static and for infrequent blogging. I complained to my hosting provider more frequently, and projected a sense of urgency that was probably disproportionate. I was left with a feeling of <em>if my website is down, I do not exist</em>, and I found myself wondering if sysadmins in a data center the other side of the world could possibly know or care about the anxiety they were causing me.</p>

                    <p>Other, predicted, psychological impact was that publicly logging photos of all of my purchases made me more conscious about what I bought. <em>Even though I didn't actually think anyone looked at my feed</em>, I found being aware that someone <em>could</em> see it helped me to, for example, resist buying junk food at the supermarket.</p>

        <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="as:content">

            <p>In this section I expand on some of the topics raised by the results of my creation and use of a PWO, and in particular the implications for Web Observatories, and Web Science as a whole. I think these results highlight many open questions and future research challenges.</p>

            <p>PWOs are at the intersection of Web Observatories and Personal Data Stores. Research on the former is concerned with passively collecting and analysing how individuals and communities already use the Web, in order to learn about society. Research on the latter is concerned with improving and often actively influencing the lives of individuals. When we think about integrating individual data stores into an architecture for mass observation, we need to find a way to account for the conflicts that arise.</p>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTL" property="as:content">

                    <p>Good user interfaces for visualising data from logs and perhaps making recommendations for improvements to a particular aspect of someone's life can be a strong way to encourage people to engage in self-tracking. However given the potential for compulsive behaviour around self-tracking, we also need to enable people to be 'off the grid' without affecting their overall aggregates or statistics. The motivational write-every-day site 750words.com has a 'vacation' setting, by which you can tell the system when you'll be away so that it doesn't penalise you for 0-word days during this time. If self-tracking is going to become the norm (as implicit self-tracking via social media already is in certain parts of the world, and as would be beneficial for Web Observatories) then taking breaks from tracking should be part of that norm. The benefits of continuous self-tracking can be acknowledged, but disconnecting can also be accepted as a healthy practice. Building this in from the outset can perhaps help to mitigate against internalised normalisation of surveillence, too.</p>

                    <p>Relatedly, the effects of missing data or inaccurate logs for any reason may have a damaging psychological effect on people. I posit that an important part (and in fact an ethical responsibility) of Web Science research would be to examine these effects with at least as much priority as working on the best gamification techniques for encouraging people to self-track.</p>

                    <p>It is critical that interfaces for visualising data logs are effective in helping the subject of the data to interpret its meaning. On the one hand, simply displaying correlations may incline people towards inferring spurious cause-effect relationships; on the other hand, as members of the QS community have shown, individuals may be far more effective at interpreting their own data than a third party service - which is perhaps missing other relevant information - could be. A challenge for PWOs would be to offer data visualisation interfaces which not only take into account all available data, but account for what is (or might be) missing as well.</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, there is no one-size-fits-all for causing positive behavioural change based on self-tracking. How we can use personal data logs to improve the lives of individuals might vary by personality as well as the social and cultural context in which the tracking takes place. Ways of <em>tailoring</em> PWOs may be extremely important when it comes to actually benefitting their users.</p>

                    <p>From a traditional social media Web Observatories perspective, subjects are not aware necessarily that their data is being observed and analysed by academics. People use social media for different reasons, and I suspect that enabling social scientists to understand the world is pretty far down the list. Especially given the assumption that users of PWOs are actively opting in to being observed, and perhaps have fine grained control over what can and cannot be used for the purposes of research, is going to impact how they engage in self-tracking. As people shape and are shaped by social media use, people will shape and be shaped by their use of PWOs. What are the tradeoffs when it comes to benefits to individuals, and benefits to academic research? How can we take this into account when drawing conclusions from collected data?</p>

                <h4 property="as:name">Technical considerations</h4>
                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="as:content">

                    <p>People are likely to be discouraged from using a PWO if it comes with a high burden of maintenance or cost of running [<a href="#vk14">11</a>]. I was able to minimise the impact of this on myself by integrating it into a system I was already maintaining (my personal website). Doing this had a significant impact on the technologies I was able to use, which was in some ways restricting, but beneficial in the long term. Shared Web hosting, PHP and MySQL are widespread and well-supported; this demonstrates that a PWO need not be architected around specialist or niche technologies, and need not be difficult or burdensome to set up and use. Certainly lowering the barrier to entry to people who <em>already</em> run their own websites could help to springboard adoption.</p>

                    <p>Centralised services are frequently bought out, shut down, or change focus or terms of service. Whilst the technical burden of maintaining ones own personal data store may be higher than delegating this to a third-party comes with different, but not insubstantial, risks.</p>
                    <!-- <p>However, if something <em>did</em> go wrong, I had the responsibility to fix it; but nobody was depending on the system but me, and it was usually caused by me in the first place. The dynamic in the case of developing PWO software for others to use, even if distributed and hosted in the same way as, say, Wordpress, would be completely different.</p> -->

                    <p>Serious review of common practices and formal Web standards can smooth the path to interoperability between different instances of WOs and PWOs. Though the standards discussed in this article were designed from a decentralised Social Web perspective rather than a Web Observatories one, the overlap is clear. Implicit self-tracking that makes up a part of ordinary social media use can be supported in the move towards decentralisation, and privacy-preserving PWOs may start to exist as a side-effect. In my implementation, I did not address the use case from [<a href="#vk14">11</a>] of aggregation of data from a crowd to produce net benefit. This is also something that shared use of open standards, in particular for data representation, subscription and notification, could facilitate.</p>

                    <p>Anticipation of future needs is raised as a challenge by [<a href="#vk14">11</a>]. With regard to my changing motivations and day-to-day requirements, I did not set out with a specific list of things I wanted to record and design the system around that. Instead, I used a flexible schemaless architecture which meant that for any new type of data I decided to log I had a minimum of new engineering to do: build a client (or potentially hook up a sensor) to generate the data; and (optionally) create a template to view it.</p>

                    <p>Working with open standards for creating, updating and deleting data helped here too, as I had the option to look for pre-existing standards compliant clients to post to my data store. Conversely, others whose data stores use the server portion of the publishing protocols can use my clients with their own storage.</p>

                    <p>Discussion of Personal Data Store architectures tends to revolve around reducing fragmentation and prioritises gathering together all kinds of data in one place [<a href="#tan07">25</a>]. This results in <em>generalised</em> tools and interfaces, which try to make it possible to do a variety of things in one place. I argue that more effective and appealing applications are <em>specialised</em>: particularly good at doing one thing. Whilst the data store itself is generic, standards for decentralisation permit the decoupling of clients - both for creating and displaying data - which is perhaps the best of both worlds.</p>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="as:content">

                    <p>Web Observatories which collect data from centralised social networking sites may be vulnerable to ingesting misinformation, ranging from subconscious selective disclosure to deliberate acts of protest against privacy infringement [<a href="#lies">>10</a>]. It is difficult to say whether proliferation of <em>personal</em> WOs would mitigate this, but it becomes increasingly important to find ways to capture contextual information when data is recorded.</p>

                    <p>If Web Observatories begin to collect data from both decentralised and centralised services, it is natural to want to align the data so it can be combined into the same data set. However the source of the data cannot simply be discarded. The same type of data from different types of sources is not necessarily equivalent or directly comparable. Just as different centralised social media sites (and the communities and subcommunities within) have their own cultural norms and expectations, as well as technical constraints or affordances, individual personal data stores come with their own unique contextual information as well. In the decentralised case, the context for data logs may be more difficult to discern, as well as capture.</p>

                    <p>To take a concrete example: for researchers to find more meaning in the logs in my PWO they need to look at in the context of <em>all</em> of the systems I interact with. My system forwards text notes and longer articles to Twitter, which in term drives traffic back to my site where all my other kinds of logs can be seen. Researchers studying my data would need to consider how my awareness of my Twitter audience (directly through known followers and extended through <em>their</em> audiences in the case of retweets) impacts all of the content I post. This might be different for someone who shares their PWO content with a different social network, or not at all.</p>

                    <p>The interface used to log the data can also have an impact. Whilst I use a Web form based user interface to check in to a place, someone else might generate exactly the same data automatically by the GPS on their phone, making less of a conscious effort to record their movements. Researchers studying how people use, for example, Swarm, have the advantage of knowing that the interface used by everyone is consistent as well as being able to directly explore it themselves. I anticipate that PWOs will be far more diverse, personalised to fit into their users' day-to-day lives, and possibly inaccessible to researchers.</p>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="as:content">
                    <p>Using data from QS activities for scientific research comes under fire for a number of reasons: self-reported data may be unreliable or biased; context is often lost when quantifying qualitative data; and data collection is limited to individuals who are inclined to record details about their lives [<a href="#sleep">2</a>]. Though I am not using the <em>contents</em> of my data logs in this report, the same issues apply to my recall of the effects of logging.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps most importantly, though the length of the study is significant, my sample size is 1. As such, I make no claims about generalisability or conclusivity of the results. I am documenting these experiences as a starting point, to begin to explore Personal Web Observatories in depth, and to highlight areas for focus in the future; this is similar to [<a href="#tan07">25</a>], in which the authors conducted their research on <em>MyLifeBits</em> with large amount of a single person's data as well.</p>

                    <p>I invested a considerable amount of time in building new features, fixing bugs, and making small improvements and adjustments to my PWO. As the only user and only developer, I was first to notice if something wasn't working properly, and unhindered by conflicting interests or opinions when it came to making changes. This has advantages for rapid prototyping of a somewhat novel system, as well as commitment to the ideology of <em>dogfooding</em>: if I don't want to use a system I've built, why should anybody else? It similarly meant that features I lost interest in fell by the wayside, whilst features I used regularly were well-maintained, so I didn't invest time in developing unnecessary functionality as I might have done had I been designing this for others. Whilst use cases and UI improvements were constrained strictly to my personal needs, and discussion of features was limited to a handful of like-minded developers, this approach was nonetheless appropriate for the purposes of this analysis.</p>

        <h3 property="as:name">Conclusions</h3>
        <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="as:content">
            <p>This article documents a year of developing and <em>using</em> a PWO. By taking the role of subject, not only developer, I have come to a better understanding of the day-to-day impact of PWO technology on an individual. 'Small data' is of interest to the academic community in terms of understanding how individuals engage with their own self-tracking activities and outputs, as well as to highlight the diversity of contexts in which data is logged and how this can impact analysis of an aggregation.</p>

            <p>I believe that Personal Web Observatories are more useful when intimately personalised for the individual user. Small scale, pluggable components may help to enable this, and using open standards to integrate components can help with designing specialised logging clients or data interpretation interfaces. This gives users more choice to pick and choose the tools they use with their personal data store, as well as making it easier to add and remove components as desired.</p>

            <p>This does not mark the end of my self-tracking experiment, but the beginning of the next phase. Over the next twelve months, I expect to add to my repository: data about mood and health (specifically headaches); the people I spend time with offline, and amount of time spent chatting online; and to add more detail about exercise, and to re-start tracking sleep. I will continue to self-track publicly, but experiment with different views over my data for others, so that vistors to my site from different contexts (eg. professional) are not overwhelmed with data, nor left with an impression of inappropriate oversharing.</p>

            <p>Finally, I want to reiterate that <em>providers</em> of PWOs have a great responsibility to the individuals whose data they host. For people who engage in frequent self-tracking, a disruption in service can provoke a minor existential crisis... so such an arrangement should not be entered into lightly.</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Conflict or power imbalance arises when one party imposes frontstage expectations on another party's backstage behaviour. For example:</p>

        <p>My landlady recently complained to me about an experience she had with a short-term guest in my shared apartment. On the day of the guest's checkout, my landlady had arranged to come over and collect the keys and return the deposit at a certain time. She arrived one hour early, without letting the guest know. She was shocked to find dishes unwashed, jars left open, food on the counter, and the guest watching a movie on the sofa in her underwear. She told me this was "not a good guest", bemoaning the untidiness.</p>

        <p>Little does she know that that is often what the apartment looks like when I am home alone and she is not due for a visit. Nonetheless, because I have learned her tendency to turn up unannounced, as well as her penchant for tidiness, I make more effort to keep on top of cleaning day-to-day.</p>

        <p>The problem here is that the guest was engaging in backstage activities, because she did not anticipate being observed for another hour. The guest fully intended to have the apartment clean and ready at the agreed time, and was entitled to behave as she pleased (enjoying her vacation) until then. Similarly, my landlady has every right to enter the apartment she owns when she chooses, however she does *not* have a right to expect that everyone therein behave constantly as if she were already present. She fails to acknowledge that her guests are going to behave differently when she is not around, and is holding her guests at fault for her flawed expectations.</p>

        <p>One part of engaging in appropriate self-presentation is understanding and accounting for the expectations of those present: our audience. Even when thrown in to unexpected scenarios, we usually have some chance to react and accommodate in face-to-face interactions. When we are unable to do so, unpleasant social situations arise.</p>

        <p>Online, we present a face but cannot see our audience. We may have no reliable information about who are audience are or their expectations, or we may <em>imagine</em> a different audience to the one(s) we really have. Furthermore, multiple audiences may access our single 'face', and we have no opportunity to adapt and change our presentation to suit their expectations.</p>

        <p>This section deals with an experimental implementation which attempts to address the problem of accommodating audience expectations with our unified online face.</p>
