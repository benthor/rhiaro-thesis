# The Presentation of Self Online

The main goal of this chapter is to cover previous work and empirical evidence of how people present themselves, as a basis for better supporting them.

..sections for social vs individual construction ..
.... political, cultural, racial. stuff about web dissolving these, but not really

## Presentation of self

socsci literature

* Goffman
    - Perfomativity
    - Front stage and back stage
* boyd
* Turkle (2nd half of Alone Together)
* Giddens, Modernity (identity as separateness/uniqueness; personal construction as opposed to ascription due to the loss of traditional anchors. Construction of "self" as an "ongoing project")

## Offline to online... and back again

When people use digital technologies to communicate, they are passing a version of themselves through the filter of the platform they use. Aspects of their offline identity may be mediated by a particular technology as they input into a system, and similarly as their input is consumed by the reciever, who may even be using a different technology. 

..Similarities and differences between Goffman's frontstage and back stage...

Online identities are not only a reflection of offline identities, but the inverse can be true as well. Feedback loop.

## Youth online

Social self-presentation literature applied to the online space is mostly applied to these aliens called 'young people'

socsci/websci literature, boyd

Introduce concepts of 

* Context collapse 
* imagined audience
* networked publics

### Narcissism

Constructing an ideal self, a facade. Social media often critiqued as encouraging narcissistic behaviour, especially with teens.

## Bloggers

..speaking of networked publics...

* Lots of work on identity and bloggers, especially wrt journalism/media.
* Russell, A. (2009) International Blogging. -> various studies from a non-Western perspective <-

Identity is both individually and socially constructed. Identity expression through personal blogs is very individualistic; bloggers have traditionally had quite a bit of control over not only what they choose to share and write about, but how it is presented, organised and laid out. ..[@thatbloggingstudy] describes importance of themes and designs, and mentions that some people use a feed reader to subscribe but click through to the original post to read in context...

Whilst bloggers (during peak blogging years like 2007) do collaboratively construct their identities through interactions with the community, they were mostly restricted to commenting on other people's posts. This fragments their contributions across different domains, and where their writing style and topics constitute a part of their identity, so it fragments their identity.

Present day social media has dramatically increased participation in publishing and sharing online content [@citationeeded]. Easy-to-use services lower the barrier to entry for connecting with and pushing thoughts out to an audience. Identities expressed through social media are inherantly collaborative; every interaction is pushed to a network, and part of a dynamic cycle of consumption and creation feedback. Commenting on someone else's post automatically links it to your own profile, and often it appears there as well, accessible from two different contexts. Yet they permit little customisation, providing preset options for content or reaction templates, and consistent inflexible designs for profile pages. This tips the balance away from the individual aspect of identity construction, and differentiates current social media practices from a generation of bloggers who populated the web prior to the mainstream adoption of social media.

## To share or not to share (privacy and social media)

Tensions between convenience of sharing on social media and increasing awareness of privacy concerns.

Does self-censorship stifle personal expression? How does this impact identity construction?

## Technoself

Dive into this... 'field' since 2013.. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technoself

## Social machines

how does considering online social stuff as social machines affect how we understand profile creation and impression management?

cross-platform, cross-community, imagined audience

Specifically thinking about social machines lets us emphasise the multiple contexts in which people are managing their identity, rather than constraining to per-platform/per-technology/per-task studies.

Identity in social machines. How to explore identities when part of a crowd? Reputation in a coordinated whole needs consistency and reliability. Apps as tools for individuals, vs/and tools for social coordination.

In the same way applications restrict users, how might social machines designed with some purpose inhibit users? How can we build social machines with space for exploration and innovation by participants? How crucial is self-presentation of participants for this?

## Constructing online identity

This section presents empirical studies of online identity practices in three different areas: active content creators using centralised social media; active content creators using decentralised systems; and, deception as a tool for social impression management.

### Content creators

dump most of SOCM14 paper here

### indieweb

Interviews

Does the indieweb attempt to recapture the more individualistic aspects of identity management, whilst retaining audience and feedback - collaborative identity construction - on the scale enabled by centralised services?

### Pro-social deception

Deception as a tool for social impression management online

  * Lying survey
  * lieCloud case studies

Magic quadrant for this stuff? Unconscious vs conscious effort 

but also people-system, leads to... ----> chapter 3!

## Conclusions

do we run a risk of losing out on the collaborative aspects of identity construction if we designs decentralised systems which aren't sufficiently federated? Must acknowledge the criticality of interaction for identity formation.

### Limitiations and reflections

My perspective. Western bias.

Reading all these studies from the last five to ten years about teens' changing attention, changing priorities, changing emotional states (or ways of handling it) due to technology, it occurred me to me they're talking about me (or is that narcissistic?). Some things I read are instinctively familiar; obvious. Some are ridiculous. How does my first-hand experience of growing up with technology affect my reading of studies, and my ability to study others?

# Notes



## digitalvertigo

### AJ Keen 2012

Solitude is important and impossible.

Expectation of self surveillence is harmful and devisive. He asks, for those who prefer solitude, will they cease to exist?

"Publicness grants immortality" - Public Parts, Jarvis 2011

Facebook makes CIA redundant, cites The Onion.. => what exactly does CIA care about? not your breakfast.

Employers and colleges checking social media (33)

Lots of references to social/search services that are dead now ^^

1984 ownlife

Reid Hoffman - 'transparency rewarded integrity' = Trust economy

Jarvis - publicness will result in more tolerant society (52)

Keen - not. 'open architecture often encourages thos ecompletely lacking in integrity to wreck the reputations of innocent people'

Dalton Conley - intraviduals. Caught between completing identities (<=== BS)

Reputation, competition, actually isolates us as we compete for others' attention. "cloud of glory" - Tresch (119)

Reinvention

Panopticon prisoners - reduced from human beings with their own lives into packaged timelines of processed information (146)

hyperreality - the completely real becomes completely fake.

Imagine a hotel that's a prison - a place that incarcerates us without knowing it (149)

...Turning us into... (179)

forget who we are, what it is to be human (192)


## In Real Life

### Nev Schulman 2014

People creating fake identities to escape. Idealised versions of themselves so people will treat them differently. (Or, to exploit others).

Says this results in people hiding from, rather than dealing with, actual problems. Like portraying yourself how you like online is a bad thing. Usually negative repercussions for you and the people you mislead. Reasons: appearance, sexuality, control, fear, addiction, fantasy.

"fantasy gets in the way of real progress" (42)

==> thinking about 'deception' profiles from the 'hopefuls' perspective.

"we feel safer behind the screen" (89) Less social since no physical.

"we all lie online to varying degrees" (95) => Surveys

"online culture of dishonesty"

"the way you are perceived seems so much more important than what you actually are" (97)

"It should go without saying that we should strive to be honest and honerable in everything we do and say, online and off." (106)

Employers and colleagues googling you and examples (116)

"in the future, everyone will want their 15 minutes of anonymity" (122)

127 - 'rules' for online dating profile, all about honesty but not too revealing.

## Infinite Reality

### Blascovich & Bailenson 2011

"dozens of psychological experiments have shown that..." peoples' avatars affect their IRL, ie. confidence, exercise. (4)

==> this opposes Nev In Real Life

Avatars: "completely anonymous but inherantly traceable"

What is reality?

Convincingness of VR

actual, implied and imagined presence of others - Gordon Allport

Important in VR is belief a person holds about a representation.

Theory-of-mind

Virtual contexts bring different norms and expectations (81)

People behaving differently based on uniforms/colour clothes. Self-perception -> unconscious behaviour (102)

Comparison of avatars with clothes.

Turkle 1995 - playing with unexplored aspects of self (103) turkle quote

How avatar changes behaviour

Nick Yee thesis: EverQuest + WoW self-presentation (104) -> effects of virtual on IRL found (107) "their virtual presence carried over to the physical realm and they did not feel the need to exaggerate"

"role playing... has consequences... for behaviours carried over into the physical world" (114) Age, obesity, race

"the notion of self is fluid in virtual reality" (120)

Scenario where virtual avatar programatically behaves differently to different people (124) Experiment with students engagement with teacher in classroom improved when student thought teacher was making eye contact with only them (but was with all) (128) And scenarios with other students attentive or distracted.

Secondary avatars, semi-controlled to do tasks in games (153)

How do we know who is behind/controlling an avatar (/profile). Agents. 'Hidden cameras' of virtual reality (155)

==> Dmitri Williams - social science methods to study virtual worlds. (160)

==> Sandy Pentland reality mining

Digital footprints to detect liars, psychosis, leadership... @no way to hide the fact that one is a dog" (168)

"even the roles we play are up for grabs in virtual reality. Avatars can reveal sides of people they themselves never knew existed." (260)

## App Generation

### Gardner & Davis 2013

=> Davis thesis blogs identity youth Bermuda

Three Is - identity, intimacy, imagination - have been reconfigured by apps

Teens crafted online persona ~ true sense of self (feed into each other)

Facebook relationship status option s- "give rise to new forms of imaginative expression... application shapes and restricts these expressions in distinct and distinctive ways" 6

=> "An 'app' or 'application' is... tightly controlled by the individual or organisation that designed teh app." 6

Weird idea that if there isn't an app for something it doesn't matter 8

App-enabling vs app-dependant 10

5 year study 150 young people in New England and fewer in Bermuda. 7 focus groups with 6-10 adults who have worked with young people for >20 years. 40 interviews with high school teachers. Compared student art (writing and graphics) gathered over 20 years - how changed.

Need to consider how earlier technologies like telephone defined youth 13

Proposes that generations may be defined by dominant technologies (=> too fast!)

Componants of technlogy: tools and machines, information, media, human psychology.

McLuhan alert 22 Each medium, extension of human sensory organs, alters relation of individual to the surrounding world.

Devices more personal - control over what is sent and received - compared to radio and TV (=> compare to who controls apps though?)

'The paradox of action and restriction' 24

"Can constitute a challenge - asking us what we can accomplish despite these restrictions" 25

"wrt identity formation: Apps can short-circuit identity formation, pushing you into being someone else's avatar - or, ... they can allow you to approach identity formation more deliberately, holistically, thoughtfully." 32

"prepackaged identity", "endless role diffusion"

Pro tech - danah, Cathy Davidson, Henry Jenkins, Shirky, David Weinberger.

Anti tech - Nicholas Carr, Mark Bauerlein, Cass Sunstein, Sherry T, Janen Lamien(?)

"we believe more and more young people are app-dependant than app-enabled" 45

Young people expressing consistency between online and offline selves 63

But online is often a 'polished' version. Not one-to-one. Youth interviwed said online identity is 'less complete' than offline 64

Sometimes due to constraints of platform. More common - privacy.

"Do apps open up or constrain identity expresson?" 66

"The standard elements of a profile on facebook... are used to package the self for public consumption" 71 "Presentation and performance are also central on YouTube"

Narcissism - constant need for support/validation/self-assurance, enabled by web. But young people less secure and more risk-averse, hopeless.

Identities with religious communities lessened; young people identify with multiple groups "sympathies are distributed" More accepting of diversity. 87

Access to wider range of online communities means niche identities don't have to be set aside to fit in 90 - enabling

"apps to augment or replace offline relationships?" 110

Responsibility on parents and app developers to steer towards enabling over dependant.

## Born Digital

### Palfrey and Gasser 2008

Obviously dated. Addressed to old people who are scared of da youts.

Explains how 'digital natives' are so vastly different then goes on to say how they're not different at all. That's okay I suppose.

Online enables fluid experimentation with identity but also keeps a record so identities are traceable.

"Digital natives almost never distinguish between the online and offline versions of themselves", "multiple representations inform her overall identity"

=> Identity management = multiple presentations of self on facebook DiMiccio and Miller - says should build tools to support bridging communities.

=> Youth, Identity and Digital Media

=> Huffaker and Calvert, Gender Identity and Language Use in Teenage Blogs

=> Calvert - Identity Construction on the Internet

"changes are far greater for social than for personal identity"

Reward vs risk of self-disclosure. Young people understimate risks. 25

"The structural design of online platforms both constrains and builds upon these means of building networks of identity and trust"

=> Still quite a lot of focus on the visuals of avatars, 'controlled' by user, like wearing a mask. I suppose that's the most obvious way of telling ifn someone is trying a new 'identity' if they design an image for themselves that physically different. 'Virtual worlds'

34 "can adjust her digital identity with ease, but has far less ability to control how her identity is percievied by others", "she appears to have much more control over her identity but in fact she has much less"

"more bound to a single identity"

"identities might converge... even more than identities ever converged before the digital era."

"...created multiple identities... might be connected to create a much fuller picture of the individual... spanning a greater period of time."

36 "Most digital natives have an instinct about... identity expression an dformation in a digital age"

## International Blogging

### 2009 Adrienne Russell, Nabil Echchaibi

Focus on non-US. Counter to work that says spread of blogging as spread of Western democratic ideals. "power dynamics offline influence developments online".

Audience reception theory (Ang 1985)

US media practice remade around the world to better suit needs (Appadira 1996). Media technologies as often oppressive as liberating. Blogging celebrated as extended public journalism.

Theme in this book: blogs to "negotiate and articulate identity"

"many uses of blogs... talking about blogging as a uniform act with well-defined goals can be misleading" (Bruns and Jacobs 2006). Arguement for individual case studies instead of generalisations.

Difference between A list blogs and smaller ones. We need to study latter, but rarely do so. "not only incarnate better the potential of Internet users to challenge elite control of news production, but they also show us on a smaller scale how individuals and communities use netowrk technologies to sustain new forms of social, cultural and economic solidarity" (12)

Circa 2007 people saw blogging as revolutionary and empowering for individuals, decentralising. "we live in a new era of complex and non-linear communication" (15)

#### Paris banlieues

Individual and community identities defined by mainstream media - blogs allow people to redefine their identities for themselves (23). Had a knock-on effect on traditional media re: Paris banleiues

#### Muslim

"Blogging as a cultural practice" (29)

"the inherant and irreducible dynamism of any identity"

Reading 25 blogs over 9 months in 2007, specifically Muslim authors, themes linked to Islam, all English.

"How is publicness reconfigured in Muslim blogs?", "concurrent existence of both intellectual, reasoned analysis and arguements with emotional expressions and responses"

Structural societal biases strip Muslims of rationality, but blogging empowers them to express in-depth analyses alongside reasoned and justified emotional responses.

Posting comments on blogs enables publicness, as publicness entails dialogue (39)

"almost seamless merging of political/public themes with the more personal/private ones". Typically private issues (by Euro standard) become issues for public discussion. "the lines between private and public are constantly shifting, and perhaps blogs might be ghtough of as contributing to such shifts" (40)

Blogging opens for dialgue but not guarentee it (commentors are dumb) - cannot expenct consensus. More to kick start debate. 

=> Giddens - modernity and self-identity. Identity as separateness and uniqueness. Also personal construction rather than ascription now due to loss of traditional anchors. "having a self means being in charge of an ongoing project" (24)

"Muslim identities are considered to be more or less uniform and Muslim people appear interchangeable with each other rather than unique individuals... However blogging acts in ways that effectively establish the separateness and uniqueness of each blogger, first by naming and authoring a blog and secondly by having a unique URL address" (42)

'I' and 'me' as claiming the blog as part of the blogger's identity => (Amir-Ebrahimi 2004, Reed 2005)

"blogging combines identity-in-the-making with connection with others, who also help define this identity. Thus for a blogger to choose and list their friends and their enemies, to write about who and what they like or not, show that they mutually define each other" ... "the fact that the blogger has discretion over most parts of the blog, shows that indeed to some extent they define and construct their own identity, while on the other the mobilization of other blogs or blog entries in doing so, denotes the collaborative or social elements of this construction".

"Muslim blogging reconfigures identity as both shared-ness and unique-ness" (does it?)

"ways in which blogging practices can reenter or feed back into both the formal, institutional aspects of life, and into the everyday politics of coexistence"

* Amir-Ebrahimi, 2004, Performance in everyday life and the rediscovery of the 'self' in Iranian weblogs
* Alexanian, J. 2006 Publicly initimate online: Iranian weblogs in Souther CA
* Burns and Jacobs 2006 Use of blogs
* Giddens 1991 Modernity and self-identity
* Reed 2005 "My blog is me"

Blogs analysed 25, 11 blogspots, 4 wordpress.com, 1 blogsome, 9 domains (1 sub .pickledpolitics.com)

#### China

"bloggers defining themselves for an international audience"

"If they become popular, these writers may be confronted with responses hitherto reserved fr professional news outlets, in particular challenges to their authenticity or character" (47)

"instead of abandoning ethnicity and other markers of identity as was originally predicted (Turkle 1995), bloggers and others who participate in online communities deliberately identify themselves in these terms of ethnicity and culture"

5 blogs online since 2002.

Saying that Chinese blogging is a Western imposition assumes that Chinese are not shaping blogosphere and can only conform to existing standards, and that they can't choose how or when to use blogs. (49)

Forums and listservs are pre-blog

"On the Internet, because performing identity depends far more on self-description than on presentation of direct 'evidence', every blogger must make choices about what to reveal and make further decisions about how to illustrate these choices." (50) We can look at choices to see what criteria seem important for defining identity.

#### Russia

History of LiveJournal is intertwined with evolution of Internet in Russia. Early internet conceptualized as grassroots, place for dialogue, domestic kitchen (vs Western 'frontier' or 'superhighway').

Split between pro- and anti-Western influence (individual)

Optimists and pessimists wrt internet and state/society.

Western 'collaborative', Russian 'collectivist'

"Power-play between self-identity and imposed lables" ... users... "suddenly, forcibly and incorrectly labelled as 'Russian'" Different words for Russia in terms of culture and Russian in terms of nation state.

#### Australia

Surprisingly (given cultural, linguistic and political similarities) different from US. "more concerned with responding to commentary seen on fellow bloggers' sites; such commentary may increasingly take place on those sites themselves than at a distance through new posts on one's own blog" (94)

Study measuring types of outgoing links in various blogs and posts but I'm not really sure why. Something about political engagement?

#### Israel

3 leading political Hebrew language blogs, and some English language Israeli-based. Structured interviews with blog founders.

Blog phenomenon: 2001 with Isra-blog, 2003 Notes, 2005 Tapuz's Blogosphere, 2006 WP template to Hebrew and Blogli (WP based)

(Focus is on solely political rather than personal blogs in this chapter). Mass media ignored political blogs. Sometimes reprinted without proper credit. "Blogs are perceived as an expression of the writer's identity as if it is a form of interpersonal interaction within a virtual community representing the publich sphere". Depoliticized.

"American bloggers think that while comments are not a requirement, they do enhance blog content dramatically" (Arrington 2006 Techcrunch: What is the definition of a blog?)

* Herring + Kouper The discursive construction of weblogs 2004

#### Arab (Morocco)

5 Moroccan blogs, Arabic, French and English language.

blogma - local blogging (contrast to rest of Arab world which is pan-Arab)

(hahaha abuse of a female blogger met with alarm and noted as outlier). "Myth" of internet as end of politics.

#### Italy

Grillo - political comedian excluded from mainstream media in 90s. Analysis of his blog for 1 year from 1 May 2005. Has become a lively community for political dissidents.

#### Singapore

Blogs as cultural and personal tools of expression:

* Blanchard 2004 Blogs as virtual communities
* Herring 2005 Conversations in the blogosphere
* Ibrahim 2006 Weblogs as personal narratives
* Nardi 2004 Why we blog

Bloggin popularised due to availability of software and major political events. "Blogs enable the privatization of public events and the publicization of the personal" (173) "cultural tools for expression or personal conduits for public ruminations". blogs "fuse global practices with local agency"

2006 Singapore general election - political blogging played a big role.

-> Applies intertextuality to hypertext

"the cultural context of offline society mediates the readings of text and images that occur online" (Miller and Slater 2000)

"the Internet is an unbound textual space which is always in the process of being produced" (175)

"As a cognitive space it conjoins the virutal and the physical spaces producing new streams of consciousness and dialogism which often locate the social context of these utterances"

Cultural taboos affect narratives. "silent discourse in offline society and the alternative discourses on the Internet"

Individual agency of blog is in direct contrast to political culture in Singapore. "The ability of technology to create new personas as well as strip and reinvent identities means that identity on the Internet cannot be neatly divided into 'insiders' and 'outsiders' or 'citizens' and 'foreigners'" (185)

* "avatarism" Judith 1998 Identity and deception in the virtual community.

"what is contraversial or novel for the community can be influenced by offline societal norms" (189)
