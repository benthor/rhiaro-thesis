The goal of this thesis is to bridge established social science research about how people manage their self-impression and social relationships with a practical, developer-centric perspective on building social web applications to optimise current and future systems for online social interactions for individual and collective empowerment.

An assumption is that decentralised is better and putting people back in control of their data is more useful.

We begin with a literature survey of fundamental ideas from social sciences about the presentation of self, as well as more recent early work from social and computer sciences (and media?) about how people use such systems to express themselves and connect with others. Grounded in this, we discuss the current state of the art of social networking sites (SNSs); in particular how they fail to meet--or even violate--users' social needs, as indiciated by the ways in which users bypass the various constraints imposed upon them.

In chapter 3 we discuss the concept of an online profile as a tool for self expression, and present the results of an empirical study of the features of profiles from 20 social tools. We conclude that what constitutes a suitable *profile* is context-dependant and varies with individual and community needs. We use the results of our study to build a taxonomy of online social profiles which can be used to describe and compare current systems and new ones as they emerge.

Chapter 4 takes a brief look at the history of implementation and standardisation efforts for decentralised online social interactions, leading up to the present day contributions of the W3C Social Web Working Group. We present criteria for successful standards and contribute to  discuss the implications of the standards
