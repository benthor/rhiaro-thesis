  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Web users are engaging in computer-mediated self-expression in varying ways. The technology that enables this is developing fast, and how it does so is influenced by many more factors than just the needs of the people it touches. This chapter explores literature about the impact of computer-mediated self-expression on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>people's everyday lives.</li>
      <li>individual self-expression and exploration.</li>
      <li>interactions and relations with others.</li>
      <li>interactions with and expectations of society and community.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We ground our discussion in established literature about non-digital self-expression and identity from the social sciences. This raises the key theme of individuals desiring <strong>control</strong> over how others see us, yet wanting to behave in a way that is <strong>authentic</strong>, or consistent with their internal identities. There is also emphasis on the collaborative and collective nature of identity formation; that is, our self-presentation fluctuates depending on the people we're with or the situtuation or societal <strong>context</strong> we're in. The focus on face-to-face interactions and <strong>embodiment</strong> leads us to draw contrasts between online and offline experiences, and to look at the substitutes for the body in digital spaces.</p>

    <p>The extent to which online and offline identities interact and overlap is hotly debated. Is creating an online identity a chance to reset, to rehsape yourself as an ideal? Or are you simply using it to convey true information about what is happening in your daily offline life? Is it a shallow, picture of you, or a forum for deep self-exploration? How does the way one portrays oneself in digital spaces feedback to ones offline self-presentation? We explore these questions in <a href="#offline-to-online-and-back-again">section 3</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="#growing-up-online">Section 4</a> examines social media use, including how one's <em>imagined audience</em> affects self-presentation in public, and how <em>context collapse</em> might occur when the actual audience is different to expected. There are several examples of techniques for managing who sees which 'version' of oneself, and the types of 'versions' of self that are commonly seen to be constructed on social media, and with what degree of transparency they are linked together. Most of the longditudinal studies in this space are of teenagers and young people, who have never known a world without social media, and who may incorporate it naturally and seemlessly into their daily practices, thus making it a core part of their identity during formative years.</p>

    <p>We focus on studies of blogging in <a href="#bloggers">section 5</a> to draw a contrast between the relationship-driven architecture of contemporary social networking sites, and the more personal, customisable blogging platforms which preceded them. Studies of bloggers and blogging communities reveal some different priorities and habits than what is common practice today, and offer insight into how online self-presentation is evolving.</p>

    <p>Throughout literature from both social and computer sciences, privacy is a common concern. In <a href="to-share-or-not-to-share-privacy-and-social-media">section 6</a> we look further at how tensions between users and the privacy settings of systems they use impact on personal information disclosure. Does self-censorship affect identity formation? How do people weigh up the risks and benefits of exposing themselves online? This is particularly pertinent for future systems development, as more and more people become aware of state surveillence, for-profit data collection, and their diminished rights over their personal data.</p>

    <p>Finally we introduce the relatively new Web Science concept of Social Machines in <a href="the-ghost-in-the-social-machine">section 7</a> in order to recapture the circular interdependencies between humans, technologies, and communities. We propose to build on current work of describing and classifying social machines to better account for the individual perspectives of participants.</p>

    <p>Ultimately we posit that online is simultaneously a reflection, a distortion, an enhancement, and a diminishment of the offline world. They impact each other in complex ways, particularly with regards to self-presentation and identity formation. The various theories and studies described in this chapter form the basis for which we conduct the investigative and technical work in the remainder of this thesis.</p>

      <div>
        <p>My perspective/bias... Reading all these studies from the last five to ten years about teens' changing attention, changing priorities, changing emotional states (or ways of handling it) due to technology, it occurred me to me they're talking about me (or is that narcissistic?). Some things I read are instinctively familiar; obvious. Some are ridiculous. How does my first-hand experience of growing up with technology affect my reading of studies, and my ability to study others?</p>

  <h2>Performing the self</h2>
  <div>

    <p>The obvious place to start when embarking on a discussion about self-presentation is Goffman. In <em>The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life</em>, Goffman posits several, now well-established, theories:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Everyone is performing. The front-stage of our performance is what we create for others - the audience - to see, so that they may evaluate and interact appropriately with us.</li>
      <li>We also have a back-stage; how we act when there is no audience, or an audience of our <em>team</em>. Our team participate alongside and collude with on the front-stage.</li>
      <li>Our performances have both conscious and unconscious aspects. That is, we consciously <em>give</em> information about ourselves to others in order to manage their impression of us, but we also unconsciously <em>give off</em> information that others may pick up on and take into account when deciding how to interact with us.</li>
      <li>Both actors and audiences are complicit in maintaining the cohesion of a situation. Peformances break down if actors break character, deliberately or accidentally, or if there is a mismatch between parties' definition of the situation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These theories of course apply to face-to-face interaction.</p>

    </ul>

    <p>Embodiment... Self-presentation is largely unconscious in the physical realm and comes naturally the most people. People may also use in-crowd markers (like a shirt with a band logo on) consciously to send certain messages to people who will recognise them, whilst not drawing any attention from people who won't.</p>

      <h2>https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2013/01/10/context-collapse-a-literature-review/</h2>
      <p>Social psychologists argue that we come to know ourselves by seeing what we do and how others react to us, and that through interaction, actors seek to maintain the identity meanings associated with each role (Burke and Stets 2009; Cooley 1902; Mead 1934).  Indeed, Mead (1934) contends that for each role the actor plays, there is a separate Generalized Other, or larger moral understanding of who the person is and how the person is expected to be in the world, and that social actors manage their roles by adhering to disparate expectations as is situationally necessary. Similarly, Goffman (1959) demonstrates the skillful ways in which social actors reveal and conceal aspects of themselves for varying audiences, maintaining separate faces within distinct social arenas, while Leary (1995) discusses playing to each audience, their values, and their perceived positive opinion of the actor.</p>

      <h3>The self in context</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Development of personal identity is not only something that happens internally. We are strongly influenced by feedback (conscious and unconscious) from others around us, as well as the particular setting and culture in which we find ourselves. Thus identity is <em>socially</em> constructed, and often is adjusted according to <em>context</em> [@cites socsci via boyd-facid].</p>

        <p><span class="notes">(self-awareness is identity situated as in society.)</span> A person's understanding of the context in which they are performing impacts their performance [@boyd-facid]. boyd argues that online, people find it much more difficult to evaluate this context, and thus run increased risk of performing inappropriately, or experience <em>context collapse</em> when multiple audiences are inadvertently combined. This is explored further in <a href="#growing-up-online">section 4</a>.</p>

        <p class="notes">…. political, cultural, racial. stuff about web dissolving these [@Turkle], but not really. [@Kenny] study about people using identity language (with a corpus of terms that corresponds to culture/society), but in content not wrt themselves or in their profiles.</p>

  <h2>Offline to online… and back again</h2>
  <div>
    <p>When people use digital technologies to communicate, they are passing a version of themselves through the filter of the platform they use. One might assume that the disembodied nature of the interactions lets people have more control over how they are "seen" by others; Turkle claims that it is "easy" to create and tweak a perfect self online [@Turkle2016]. In reality this control is affected by a great number of factors. Turkle writes that computer-mediated communication is predictable even in the ways it is unpredictable, and that people seek out this predictability over face-to-face interactions in preference to facing emotional vulnerability. Perhaps in the early days of the Web the "nobody knows I'm a dog" meme rang true, but most of the social media systems in mainstream use at the time of writing are too large and complex for the average user to fully grasp the implications of their inputs. Turkle's argument assumes that we have full understanding and control of the digital systems we use and the audiences we are reaching through them. It presumes we know exactly how and where and when the data we input will be output in the short and long term, and how others will interpret it. One aspect of this is data <em>given off</em> by users as a side effect of scrolling, typing, tapping and clicking in their browser and mobile apps which is collected in the background by a plethora of third-parties. This generates a view of the individual that they may not even realise is being compiled, and over which they certainly have no control. Further, the affordances of the technical platform may dictate how a user is able to actively express themselves, or influence what they want to share on a subconscious level. We will discuss both of these issues in more detail in <a href="chapter3">chapter 3</a>.</p>

    <p>Turkle's argument also neglects that at every crossroad in these 'predictable' systems are stationed unpredictable humans, perhaps with conflicting interests and motivations, from conception to realisation and usage. Turkle has been studying for decades how people explore, experiment and find themselves through technology, and her overriding narrative is of a desire to express an idealised version of the self; one that is not subject to any interpretation other than what the expresser desires. However, as discussed further in <a href="#growing-up-online">the next section</a> numerous studies of social media users find a variety of other reasons people use such sites.</p>

    <p>Keen [@keen2012] emphasises the risks that individuals become trapped by technology of which they have neither understanding nor control. Being swept up in cultural technology trends, social media users may unwittingly become "prisoners" of a carefully curated digital "hyperreality", the importance of which supplants their offline lives. The idea that the online self <em>replaces</em> rather than supplements the offline self also misses the nuances of how and why people use social media in the first place. Nonetheless, we agree that online worlds are certainly not just a mirror of the offline.</p>


    <p>Online identities are not only a reflection of offline identities, but the inverse can be true as well. Feedback loop.</p>

Satisfaction with how the profile matched their ideal self-presentation converged after 10 attributes, with free-form attributes tending to increase satisfaction the most.

    <div class="notes">
      <p>A battle over freedom of expression can be seen in the backlash against networks imposing real name policies~\cite{boyd2012politics}. Several networks have attempted to force users into using their `real names', sometimes linked to a requirement of official ID. While this can be cast as benevolent---encouraging good behaviour by linking people to their actions---it removes a level of identity control which many people take for granted. 
      A particularly clear example can be seen in the reaction of drag queens, who were used to being able to interact online using chosen names. Real name requirements removed a vital aspect of fluidity from their interactions, smoothed away a \emph{seamfulness} which provides both poignant performance material and a route towards group identity~\cite{lingel2015face}. Additionally, the requirement for real names and the ability to report ``fake names'' became a mechanism whereby a marginalised group could be harassed and silenced~\cite{hotmess2015selfies}. In general, an attitude that people should be happy to connect all of their identities together under a single legal name is an expression of social privilege, a result of having no features or proclivities which are socially censored.</p>
    </div>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>In Faceted Id/entity [@boyd-facid], boyd highlights several differences between self-representation offline compared to online. Embodiment is a key factor in self-presentation and she claims considerable difference between performing one's identity through appearance - eg. fashion and body language - when walking into a room, and explicitly describing oneself by entering attributes and other personal information into an online form to create a profile. The disembodied nature of online interactions means that people must find new ways to express themselves, and manage the impressions other people have of them. A lack of control over one's online self presentation is compounded by the inability to visualise - or perhaps even be aware of - the data that is collected by the systems we use. Online activities are logged over time to an extent that most individuals are not aware of; these activities, an individual's <em>expressions given off</em>, are used, largely unknowingly, for the commercial benefits of third parties. boyd suggests that visualising all of one's personal information that is available online, as well as visualising one's 'audience' or social network connections, would provide an individual with better awareness of, and so better control over, their online image. In boyd's prototype interfaces, users are explicitly asked for personal data in order to build a profile of themselves, and boyd does point out the problematic nature of this, compared with the unconscious or implicit identity performance one conducts in offline social settings.</p>

    <p>Since these prototypes were designed, social media gained widespread popularity. Most, if not all, mainstream systems request input of expicit personal data to build an initial profile, despite the discord of this activity compared with offline. However, unlike in boyd's prototypes, it doesn't stop there. Such systems encourage ongoing engagement through adding and messaging contacts with various degress of publicness, creating status updates to broadcast a current situation, production of creative media content, and feedback on content and updates created by others. As we will see in chapter 3, contemporary social media build one's profile from various combinations of these online activities, and typically use far more than the explicit data entered by the user to generate a representation of a person. Nonetheless, users may not have an accurate impression of what this representation looks like to others.</p>

    <p>Transparency of data collected, and control over how it is distributed is key to boyd's thesis of how to empower individuals online. Sadly, the situation here has not improved in the intervening eight years. Indeed, private corporations are collecting more and more personal data through free social networking sites, and granting the subjects zero rights with regard to access or distribution. Various big data scandals [@cites] that gained media attention, plus Snowden etc, mean that awareness of surveillence and personal data collection is growing amongst the general public. Later in this chapter we elaborate on how privacy concerns impact online disclosure and profile creation behaviours; we then build on the copious existing literature with an empirical study of a community of hackers intent on decentralised data storage as a means to greater control.</p>


    <p>Beyond simply visualising all of one's personal information, and the connections between social network contacts to show how personal data may flow through a network, boyd suggests that these visualisations can be used to actively segregate one's contacts along parameters which correspond to one's personal information, permitting an individual to perform identity more appropriately in digital spaces. However in practice, designing user interfaces for this proves to be challenging. For one, people aren't used to explicitly thinking about audience and context, so dividing their contacts up this way is not natural.</p>
    
    <p>An audience that is not considered by boyd (actually double check, maybe this is mentioned in Mirror), and probably others when I summarise more relevant studies here, is the wider network of data consumers beyond one's social network connections. Data derived from explicit input and implicit activities, and aggregates of thousands of 'people like you'. That is, the commercial entities, machine learning algorithms, digital marketers, advertising agencies, and our various evil corporate overlords. The tension of sharing personal data with these third parties vs. wanting to reach an audience of known human connections, is typically discussed with regards to weighing up privacy concerns; discussed later in this chapter.</p>

        <p>Observational study of over 200 blogs within a particular community, and semi-structured interviews with 40 bloggers. Identifies five aspects which affect how bloggers build their identity (name and blog title; profiles; post content; voice; affiliations; visual design) and demonstrates that use of consistent pseudonyms allows participation in a community whilst maintaining a layer of indirection between their blog-context activities and their ‘physical lives’. Pseudonymity is a norm in this community, but distrust is not of other community members, but the outside world or people who may randomly stumble across blog, or prevent the blog from showing up in search results for the author’s real name. Identity performed through initial setup of information displayed on and appearance of blog is reinforced by content, activities and interactions over time. Pseudonyms are rarely changed, and when they are it’s to explore a real life transition, and audiences are usually invited along to the new blog.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Identity is both individually and socially constructed. Identity expression through personal blogs is very individualistic; bloggers have traditionally had quite a bit of control over not only what they choose to share and write about, but how it is presented, organised and laid out. ..[@thatbloggingstudy] describes importance of themes and designs, and mentions that some people use a feed reader to subscribe but click through to the original post to read in context…</p>

    <p>Whilst bloggers (during peak blogging years like 2007) do collaboratively construct their identities through interactions with the community, they were mostly restricted to commenting on other people's posts. This fragments their contributions across different domains, and where their writing style and topics constitute a part of their identity, so it fragments their identity.</p>

    <p>Present day social media has dramatically increased participation in publishing and sharing online content [@citationeeded]. Easy-to-use services lower the barrier to entry for connecting with and pushing thoughts out to an audience. Identities expressed through social media are inherantly collaborative; every interaction is pushed to a network, and part of a dynamic cycle of consumption and creation feedback. Commenting on someone else's post automatically links it to your own profile, and often it appears there as well, accessible from two different contexts. Yet they permit little customisation, providing preset options for content or reaction templates, and consistent inflexible designs for profile pages. This tips the balance away from the individual aspect of identity construction, and differentiates current social media practices from a generation of bloggers who populated the web prior to the mainstream adoption of social media.</p>

          <li>"Researchers have found that users have many friends and desire to selectively share with multiple audiences [Boyd and Ellison 2007]. However, users struggle to manage their privacy settings as they are quite complex and change frequently. As a result, users can share information more broadly than intended, even among people they have friended [Johnson et al. 2012], resulting in embarrassment or regret [Wang et al. 2011]. Rather than adjust confusing privacy settings, users may resort to various coping mechanisms such as censoring their disclosures [Wisniewski et al. 2012]."</li>

      <p><strong>From licloud paper background:</strong></p>
      <p>Deception has long been studied, both within and outwith the HCI community. Traditionally, deception has been cast in a negative light~\cite{bok1978lying}, to be used only if no other option is available. In the 1980s, however, communications researchers began to investigate the positive aspects of lying, in particular \emph{white lies}---socially acceptable lies which cause little or no harm to the recipient~\cite{camden1984WhiteLies}. </p>
      <p>In 1992, McCornack cast deception as an understandable response to complexity: ``[r]esearchers studying deception recently have begun to argue that deceptiveness is a message property that reflects a kind of functional adaptation to the demands of complex communication situations''~\cite{mccornack1009InformationManipulation}. People then manipulate the information which they share as a necessary part of participation in society. This has led to recent work on the positive aspects of deception in human computer interaction, in particular how `butler lies' are used to ease social situations~\cite{hancock2009butler}, and how systems can deceive their users for beneficial reasons \cite{adar2013Benevolent}.</p> 

      <p>Several different taxonomies of lying and deceptive behaviours have been proposed~\cite{camden1984WhiteLies,depaulo1996lying,lindskold1983categories}; 
      Anolli et al. examined a family of deceptive miscommunications, including self-deception and white lies~\cite{anolli2001DeceptiveMiscommunication}. They look at \emph{omission} of relevant information, \emph{concealment} using diversionary information, \emph{falsifaction} and \emph{masking} with alternative, false information. Of particular interest is their claim that ``a deceptive miscommunication theory should be included in a general framework capable of explaining the default communication'', that is that deception should not be seen as a psychologically different activity than `normal' communication. This tallies with the earlier approach of McCornack~\cite{mccornack1009InformationManipulation} who situates deceptive messages within the spectrum of \emph{information manipulation}. This, combined with the lens of Gricean maxims, allows for an explanation of deceptions where some of the truth is told, but information which the speaker knows is relevant to the listener is omitted or obscured~\cite{grice1970logic}. 
      %From an economic point of view, Akerlof and Schiller~\cite{schiller2015Phishing} have described  deception in terms of the maintenance of asymmetries of information, and the exploitation of cognitive failings, biases and bounded rationality.</p>

      <p>Motivations for lying have also been extensively studied in social psychology. Turner et al.'s taxonomy included \emph{saving face}; guiding social interaction; avoiding tension or conflict; affecting interpersonal relationships; and achieving interpersonal power~\cite{turner1975information}. Camden et. al.~\cite{camden1984WhiteLies} develop a detailed categorisation of lies to do with basic needs, managing affiliation with others, self-esteem and miscellaneous practices such as humour and exaggeration. 
      A recent study of online behaviour found that the most common self-reported motivation for online lies was either to make one's life seem more exciting, or to downplay personal difficulties. Responses also included avoiding harassment and a range of creative endeavours alongside more clearly adversarial deceptions~\cite{kleek2015SelfCuration}.</p>
      <p>Another strand of research borrows from information warfare, to look at the possibilities for \emph{disinformation}.  Disinformation tactics are most useful when a channel of information cannot be completely closed, but can be rendered useless by being filled with incorrect, but plausible, assertions in order to lower its overall signal-to-noise ratio~\cite{wiki:disinformation}. The intended target of the lie may not be the official recipient of the message: lies can be directed at those who are eavesdropping on the communications channel or surveilling the participants~\cite{alexander2010Disinformation}. Techniques used include \emph{redaction} to remove parts of the message, \emph{airbrushing} to blur parts of the message and \emph{blending} to make the message similar to other plausible messages, as well as other forms of  \emph{information distortion}~\cite{alexander2010Disinformation}.</p>

      <p>We are rapidly moving into a world where information about nearly every aspect of our lives is becoming sensed, recorded, captured and made available in digital form. Data is captured and shared voluntarily, as tools invite ever more intimate participatory surveillance \cite{albrechtslund2008Participatory}. While the abundance of information traces has unlocked a wide range of new kinds of applications~(eg. \cite{Akker:2014:TRP:2684563.2684638} \cite{Consolvo:2008:ASW:1357054.1357335}), the creation and potential for disclosure poses new threats to individual privacy and autonomy. The overall lack of transparency by manufacturers regarding how they are capturing and handling personal information has created a heightened sense of unease among many, in addition to the potential threats dealing with their unintentional disclosure or misuse\cite{fife2012privacy, metzger2004privacy, featherman2010reducing}.</p>

      <h3>Deception in the age of pervasive surveillance</h3>
      <p>We are rapidly moving into a world where information about nearly every aspect of our lives is becoming sensed, recorded, captured and made available in digital form.  Increasingly, every app on our  smartphones, wirelessly connected devices in our homes, and on-body worn sensing devices are capturing what we do in unprecedented detail. Dodge and Kitchin \cite{dodge2005codes} introduced the term \emph{capta} to cover the data about us which are selected and captured as we go about our lives. In addition, vast amounts of data are captured and shared voluntarily, as tools invite ever more intimate \emph{participatory surveillance} \cite{albrechtslund2008Participatory}. While the abundance of information traces has unlocked a wide range of new kinds of applications~(eg. \cite{Akker:2014:TRP:2684563.2684638} \cite{Consolvo:2008:ASW:1357054.1357335}), the creation and potential for disclosure poses new threats to individual privacy and autonomy. The overall lack of transparency by manufacturers regarding how they are capturing and handling personal information has created a heightened sense of unease among many, in addition to the potential threats dealing with their unintentional disclosure or misuse\cite{fife2012privacy, metzger2004privacy, featherman2010reducing}. </p>

      <p>There is often an asysmmetry about the collection and use of data. To take a relatively prosaic example, Facebook introduced `read receipts' on messaging, which indicate when a user has seen a message. This feature has been shown to cause anxiety when present in email systems, as users seek to maintain their \emph{responsiveness image}, the impression which they project to others about how they respond to input and partition their attention~\cite{tyler2003can}. Once ambiguity about attention has been removed, a whole class of white lies---`The internet was bad, I couldn't check my messages'---are no longer possible, and people develop alternative strategies, such as not opening messages until they feel prepared to respond.</p>

      <p>The key difference in the context of social networks is that the user does not have the same degree of control over the channel---email receipts can be switched off, while social networks offer different levels of control.  In response, a spectrum of tools and practises have emerged to re-introduce attentional privacy in messaging systems (see Section \ref{sec:existing-tools}).</p>

      <p>Beyond sensing and storing this information, these apps and devices often disclose it, such as to the app or product's manufacturer's cloud data services, or to third-party companies and services for marketing and other purposes.  </p>
    
      <p>For those wanting to not be tracked, the two primary options available: try to suppress the amount of  information being shared, or discontinue their use altogether.  In practice, however, neither option is feasible or effective; first, the ever-increasing and varied ways people are now being tracked means that people are hardly aware of how they are being tracked to begin with.  For example, most end-users have little awareness of the information being captured about them by their smartphone apps~\cite{mylonas2013delegate, wetherall2011privacy}.   Second, many of the tools that track people are so vital to their everyday work or social activities that discontinuing their use is simply not practical~\cite{}  . Finally, suppressing or falsifying information given to services only works insofar as that information is both manually supplied and inessential to delivering the provided services.   Since people's greatest concerns surround information automatically sensed and captured, such as a person's physical location or activities, suppression may simply be impossible.   With the promise of further Internet-connected `smart'  sensors becoming increasingly invisible, the problem of even knowing where embedded in the  environment these devices are may simply become impossible.</p>
    
      <p>In contrast, a different strategy to suppressing information is the use of \emph{disinformation}, in which false information is strategically added to an information channel to discredit and draw attention away from true information that could not be suppressed~\cite{}.  Such strategies have been used heavily in wartime by various counterintelligence agencies in order to reduce the damage of leaked sensitive information~\cite{alexander2010Disinformation} \ToCite{CVDazzle? Similar stuff?}. While such measures may seem extreme, they are, the concept of disinformation is quite simple.  In this paper, we hypothesise that that, when applied selectively and appropriately in contexts, the use of disinformation, like other forms of deception, can be made to benefit end-users, system designers, and even those who are disinformation targets.  </p>

      <p>We are rapidly moving into a world where information about nearly every aspect of our lives is becoming sensed, recorded, captured and made available in digital form. Data is captured and shared voluntarily, as tools invite ever more intimate participatory surveillance \cite{albrechtslund2008Participatory}. While the abundance of information traces has unlocked a wide range of new kinds of applications~(eg. \cite{Akker:2014:TRP:2684563.2684638} \cite{Consolvo:2008:ASW:1357054.1357335}), the creation and potential for disclosure poses new threats to individual privacy and autonomy. The overall lack of transparency by manufacturers regarding how they are capturing and handling personal information has created a heightened sense of unease among many, in addition to the potential threats dealing with their unintentional disclosure or misuse~\cite{fife2012privacy, metzger2004privacy, featherman2010reducing}.</p>

      <p>Many tools have been dedicated to helping people carry out various kinds of digital deception for the purpose of protecting their privacy. Without aspirations of comprehensiveness, we mention some here. Tools for masking identity are currently available for all levels of the software stack, from tools like \emph{tor} for masking the origin and destination at the network level~\cite{dingledine2004tor}, to privacy-enhancing features at the browser level.  Such browser features include \emph{Do Not Track}~\cite{tene2012track}, user-agent spoofing, and tracker and cookie-blocking capabilities~\cite{eckersley2010unique}.  At the application level, anonymous e-mail re-mailers~\cite{gulcu1996mixing}, anonymous e-Cash and cryptocurrencies~\cite{casale2015cryptocurrencies}, and anonymous secure file sharing systems~\cite{scarlata2001responder} have started to support certain activities offering guarantees of privacy under specified conditions.</p>

  <h2>The ghost in the (social) machine</h2>
  <div>

    <p>Social Machines are systems for which the human and computational aspects are equally critical. In most cases, humans do the creative work whilst machines do the administrative tasks [@Timbl1999]. Up to now, systems have not been designed <em>to be</em> Social Machines; rather, the concept and definition of a Social Machine is derived from observations of existing (usually Web-based) systems. Many are products of the contemporary social web, on many different scales and in many different domains, often evolving, responding to technological and social developments, and interacting with each other [@Hendler2010, @ByrneEvans2013, @DeRoure2013, @Strohmaier2013]. Social Machines can be identified within and across social media networks, within and across online communities, and within and across technological spaces.</p>

    <p>Social Machines are pertinent to our work here as they provide a lens through which we can examine sociotechnical phenomena which emphasises the interdependence between humans and technology. In studies of social networks discussed previously in this chapter, humans are considered as <em>users</em> of systems, and discussions focus around how people react to technology, how people behave in the context of particular technical or social constraints, or how people's lives are changed in response to their interactions with and through digital environments. It is important to also reflect upon the ways in which technology evolves or is reconceptualised as a result of passive (mis)use and active (mis)appropriation by humans. We similarly must recognise technical systems in the wider context of society, and include in our dialogue the developers who design and build technical systems, the organisations and legal entities which finance and drive them, and the cultural and economic climate in which they are situated.</p>

    <p>Social Machines which have been studied so far have been described and categorised in terms of purpose [@DeRoure2013], motivations and incentives, technology used, goals and processes, quality assessment of outputs, and user participation and interaction [@Smart2014]. The emphasis in this work is on discussing Social Machines in collective terms; that is, 'a' Social Machine - wherever its boundaries happen to have been drawn (so far these boundaries are typically drawn around the edge of a "service" [@Smart2014]) - is considered as a coherent whole. The circumstances of the individual human participants not been given extensive consideration <em class="notes">TODO: barring.. update from 2014+ lit)</em>. For any given Social Machine, individual participants are diverse and participate in different ways, with varying goals, motivations and outcomes. As we have seen with through studies of social media mentioned previously, they manipulate their online presence(s) so that they may behave in different ways according to different contexts, or may work together to construct a single image controlled by multiple people [@Dalton2013]. Such behaviour impacts our understanding of roles, autonomy and awareness, incentives and attribution, and accountability and trustworthiness of participants. Overlooking unique individual perspectives when observing a Social Machine as a whole can cause incorrect assumptions, for example: believing that participants who lie about who they are have negative intentions in a Social Machine whose overall "purpose" is to strengthen social ties. We must also bear this in mind when designing systems, so that a system may grow in response to unexpected actions of participants rather than hampering their explorations.</p>

    <p>We argue that due to the complex nature of online identity, understanding nuanced individual behaviours of participants in a more granular way is crucial for Social Machine observation. We advance this argument in {part x} through an empirical study of a Social Machine centered around creative media production.</p>

<p>Focus on non-US. Counter to work that says spread of blogging as spread of Western democratic ideals. "power dynamics offline influence developments online".</p>

<p>Audience reception theory (Ang 1985)</p>

<p>US media practice remade around the world to better suit needs (Appadira 1996). Media technologies as often oppressive as liberating. Blogging celebrated as extended public journalism.</p>

<p>Theme in this book: blogs to "negotiate and articulate identity"</p>

<p>"many uses of blogs… talking about blogging as a uniform act with well-defined goals can be misleading" (Bruns and Jacobs 2006). Arguement for individual case studies instead of generalisations.</p>

<p>Difference between A list blogs and smaller ones. We need to study latter, but rarely do so. "not only incarnate better the potential of Internet users to challenge elite control of news production, but they also show us on a smaller scale how individuals and communities use netowrk technologies to sustain new forms of social, cultural and economic solidarity" (12)</p>

<p>Circa 2007 people saw blogging as revolutionary and empowering for individuals, decentralising. "we live in a new era of complex and non-linear communication" (15)</p>

<h4 id="paris-banlieues">Paris banlieues</h4>

<p>Individual and community identities defined by mainstream media - blogs allow people to redefine their identities for themselves (23). Had a knock-on effect on traditional media re: Paris banleiues</p>

<h4 id="muslim">Muslim</h4>

<p>"Blogging as a cultural practice" (29)</p>

<p>"the inherant and irreducible dynamism of any identity"</p>

<p>Reading 25 blogs over 9 months in 2007, specifically Muslim authors, themes linked to Islam, all English.</p>

<p>"How is publicness reconfigured in Muslim blogs?", "concurrent existence of both intellectual, reasoned analysis and arguements with emotional expressions and responses"</p>

<p>Structural societal biases strip Muslims of rationality, but blogging empowers them to express in-depth analyses alongside reasoned and justified emotional responses.</p>

<p>Posting comments on blogs enables publicness, as publicness entails dialogue (39)</p>

<p>"almost seamless merging of political/public themes with the more personal/private ones". Typically private issues (by Euro standard) become issues for public discussion. "the lines between private and public are constantly shifting, and perhaps blogs might be ghtough of as contributing to such shifts" (40)</p>

<p>Blogging opens for dialgue but not guarentee it (commentors are dumb) - cannot expenct consensus. More to kick start debate.</p>

<p>=&gt; Giddens - modernity and self-identity. Identity as separateness and uniqueness. Also personal construction rather than ascription now due to loss of traditional anchors. "having a self means being in charge of an ongoing project" (24)</p>

<p>"Muslim identities are considered to be more or less uniform and Muslim people appear interchangeable with each other rather than unique individuals… However blogging acts in ways that effectively establish the separateness and uniqueness of each blogger, first by naming and authoring a blog and secondly by having a unique URL address" (42)</p>

<p>'I' and 'me' as claiming the blog as part of the blogger's identity =&gt; (Amir-Ebrahimi 2004, Reed 2005)</p>

<p>"blogging combines identity-in-the-making with connection with others, who also help define this identity. Thus for a blogger to choose and list their friends and their enemies, to write about who and what they like or not, show that they mutually define each other" … "the fact that the blogger has discretion over most parts of the blog, shows that indeed to some extent they define and construct their own identity, while on the other the mobilization of other blogs or blog entries in doing so, denotes the collaborative or social elements of this construction".</p>

<p>"Muslim blogging reconfigures identity as both shared-ness and unique-ness" (does it?)</p>

<p>"ways in which blogging practices can reenter or feed back into both the formal, institutional aspects of life, and into the everyday politics of coexistence"</p>

<p>Saying that Chinese blogging is a Western imposition assumes that Chinese are not shaping blogosphere and can only conform to existing standards, and that they can't choose how or when to use blogs. (49)</p>

<p>Forums and listservs are pre-blog</p>

<p>"On the Internet, because performing identity depends far more on self-description than on presentation of direct 'evidence', every blogger must make choices about what to reveal and make further decisions about how to illustrate these choices." (50) We can look at choices to see what criteria seem important for defining identity.</p>

<p>Cultural taboos affect narratives. "silent discourse in offline society and the alternative discourses on the Internet"</p>

<p>Individual agency of blog is in direct contrast to political culture in Singapore.

<p>User study. Fill in fake profile, vs. how it compares to personality.</p>

<p>People are able to create profiles they feel match desired self-presentation.</p>

<p>Free form is best.</p>

<p>Only a few fields sufficient.</p>

<p>Self presentation: image or idea of the self, created for social purposes.</p>

<p>In Western culture, personality traits are most important (Cousins 1989)</p>

<p>Stecher &amp; Counts 2008b - only 5 attributes needed to make meaningful inferences.</p>

<p>Self-presentation online = many factors - friends, testimonials, interests, photos, bio. More or less easily faked or controlled, eg. friends profile pics not controlled, but friends selected.</p>

<p>This study - only controlled by users: more easily faked.</p>

<p>Gosling 2003 - people usually truthful.</p>

<p>‘User stands to gain from a more nuanced understanding of how attributes contribute to desired self-presentation’.</p>

<p>Online self-presentation characterisation: status (Donath 2007), tastes (Liu 2007), personality (this, based on 1890 James taxonomy: material, social, spiritual).</p>

<p>Western = individualistic. More spiritual. Which actually means like personality and accomplishments and abilities.</p>

<h4 id="study">Study</h4>

<p>3 questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do people characterise ideal self?</li>
  <li>As they build profile, does online impression converge on ideal?</li>
  <li>What types and attributes contribute most?</li>
</ul>

<p>52 participants.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Free form: how do you want others to percieve you based on profile? Sorted answers according to James taxonomy.</li>
  <li>Create a profile - fill 22 attributes, from fb (&amp; Lampe 2006, Stecher 2008b). Minimum 10.</li>
  <li>After each attribute, rate profile against TIPI personality traits, 1-7 Likert.</li>
  <li>Rate how they want others to see them, against TIPI.</li>
</ul>

<p>Satisfaction converged at 10 attributes, which was also the most common number filled out (==» this was the required minimum!)</p>

<p>==» This study misses <em>context</em> of profile creation… Profiles usually created with a purpose/community in mind.</p>

<p>More free form / expressive attributes contributed more to satisfaction with self-representation. Exceptions - college was high, music was low.</p>

<p>Fiore 2008 - agrees free form is more predictive of attractiveness.</p>

<p>Associations with others provide identity cues - boyd &amp; Ellison 2008</p>

<p>‘Blogs differ from facebook in terms of identity expectations.’</p>

<p>Answers will help designers understand what their members might like/need.</p>

<p>Blogging different because individual members have ‘ownership over defined spaces’, ‘no clear entity either owns or defines the community as a whole’.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q1. What elements constitute and contribute to a blogger’s identity?</li>
  <li>Q2. Why do bloggers construct alternate or pseudonymous identities?</li>
  <li>Q3. How are these individual blogger identities shaped and affected by participation in the larger community?</li>
</ul>

<p>Blogademe - predominiately N. American academics.</p>

<p>Most sole authors, pseudonyms. Wide topics. Diaristic.</p>

<p>Community from topical proximity not physical proximity.</p>

<h4 id="study-1">Study</h4>

<p>Observed and engaged with since 2004. Primarily observation. Approached used by others studying online communities - Gatson &amp; Zweerink 2004.</p>

<p>Core 200 blogs, additional at various points. Field notes and archives are documentation. 40 semi-structured interviews.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>‘petite generalizations’ - Stake 1995.</p>

<p>Blogs analysed as part of collective community with overaching identity, not as individual artifacts.</p>

<p>Idenitty choices reinforce community norms. Desire to belong.</p>

<h4 id="name-and-blog-title">Name and blog title</h4>

<p>Title may expand on pseudonym. Both include clues about person and intent. Pseudonyms norm, but anonymity not accepted. Trust. Norm to use consistent pseudonym. Infrequent changes.</p>

<p>Use of changing names and blog titles to explore transitioning real life identity. Audience usually invited.</p>

<h4 id="profiles">Profiles</h4>

<p>Standard fields or free form. Blurb may appear in blog side bar. Tend to remain static over time. Statements touch upon major roles played and blog topics. Some opt for no profile.</p>

<h4 id="post-content">Post content</h4>

<p>Long term engagement gives a fuller sense of authorship identities.</p>

<p>Some assume prior readership in the language used. Indicates what’s important. Not diary, dialogue with readers. What is shared or not - communicates persona in public.</p>

<h4 id="voice">Voice</h4>

<p>Anonymous posts were identifiable from voice.</p>

<p>Some imitate each other to make a point. Affects readership/appeal.</p>

<h4 id="affiliation">Affiliation</h4>

<p>Sidebar. Blogrolls; sometimes mutliple for communities. Also non-blog links.</p>

<h4 id="visual-design">Visual design</h4>

<p>Personalise over time. Avatar. Many share photos as banner.</p>

<p>Some say they subscribe with RSS but click through to read in context.</p>

<h4 id="altogether">Altogether</h4>

<p>= comprehensive persona.</p>

<p>Surface level clues, then reinforced over time. Consistent over time.</p>

<p>A blogging identity = a context-driven representation of a person. Roots in f2f but highlights or downplay characteristics based on community.</p>

<p>High privacy concern - context collapse.</p>

<p>Pseudonyms - stable identity - critical for community development. 95% pseudonymous. Not extreme measures to keep IRL and blog separate. Just indirection layer.</p>

<p>Particiapation &gt; privacy concerns.</p>

<p>Pseudonyms are norm, marker of community membership. New members choices guided by community norms, less effort than earlier members.</p>

<p>Outsiders uncomfortable with pseudonyms. Privilige! Bloggers don’t care.</p>

<p>Blogademe bloggers are not academic focussed. ‘Whole person’ not just professional. Find that most/all accurately represent themselves. Not many dog bloggers.</p>

<p>Community shares identity/privacy protection practices. Warn each other if close to being ‘outed’ by too revealing posts. Distrust is not of others in the community, but random people stumbling across.</p>

<p>Identities constructed in context of community.</p>

<p>Tension between privacy and community.</p>

<p>“bloggers must deal with the complexity of representing themselves accurately while at the same time protecting themselves from being readily identified outside the community. <em>Such is the challenge of discussing potentially sensitive or personal details in a public, archived and indexable format</em>”</p>

<h3 id="stendal-2012">Stendal 2012</h3>

<p>This is a giant literature review with lots of stuff about the methodology for doing literature reviews.</p>

<p>People with disabilities have problems with access and acceptance. Little research on virtual worlds and disabled people. 54 articles reviewed and categorised.</p>

<p>Online provides control over disclosure of impairment - Bowker and Tuffin 2002.</p>

<p>New friendships and reduced isolation - Bradley &amp; Poppin 2003.</p>

<p>Virtual worlds are potentially harmful if they fail to provide users with option to conceal disability - Ford 2001.</p>

<p>Some functionality may reconstruct disability - Carr 2010.</p>

<p>Inclusion in Second Life - Stewart 2010.</p>

<p>Studies of virtual worlds focus on rehabilitation or games that teach life skills.</p>
