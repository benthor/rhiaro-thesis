                        <p><strong>Why?</strong> Technical constraints and affordances can have a big impact on what people are able to express through a system. I charted and compared these to get a feel for the common variations.</p>
                        <p>Key findings:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Diverse types of data make up a profile.</li>
                            <li>APIs tend to subset UIs, so alternative UIs are limited.</li>
                            <li>A system's model of audience and the role and importance of connections affect both access control and distribution of data.</li>
                            <li>Little expectation of profile use beyond the system in which it is created.</li>
                            <li>Profiles may be a means to an end, or an end in themselves.</li>

                        <p><strong>Why?</strong> Systems may appear to have an overall goal or direction, but individual motivations and methods for participation can vary greatly.</p>

                        <p><strong>Why?</strong> Using McCornack's definition of 'deception', we know people deceive online for many reasons. This study tries to describe and explain them.</p>
                        <p>Key findings:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reasons are mostly benign, and often conducive to improved social interactions.</li>
                            <li>Sometimes for safety or necessity.</li>
                            <li>Sometimes for improved understanding of oneself or others.</li>
                            <li>Often the system pushes back.</li>
                            <li>Deception is a tool to cope with complexity, and online spaces offer new levels of complexity for social interactions.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>People may trust a system more if they are asked for less.</li>
                            <li>Systems are not designed for a multi-faceted life, or contextual authenticity.</li>

                        <p><strong>Why?</strong> A niche community with ideals of data ownership, and rejection of the mainstream roles of centralised social media; it's unclear if this is a concrete trend, but worth investigating attitudes in the face of prospective wider decentralisation.</p>
                        <p>Key findings:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Control over visuals is important for self-expression.</li>

                            <li>My website = my rules. No need to directly meet expectations of a platform or community <em>but</em> they are affected anyway by third-party platforms due to cross-posting.</li>
                            <li>Importance of how long content sticks around for (longevity vs ephemerality).</li>

                        <p>Key takeaways (but we already knew these really):</p>

                            <li>Open standards are important for maintaining control over self-expression but remaining connected with others.</li>
                            <li>Specialised applications are better than generalised ones.</li>
                            <li>Researchers will need to be aware of vastly different Cs when studying decentralised systems, or nodes in systems, in the future.</li>
