  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Web users are engaging in computer-mediated self-expression in varying ways. The technology that enables this is developing fast, and how it does so is influenced by many more factors than just the needs of the people it touches. This chapter explores literature about the impact of computer-mediated self-expression on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>people's everyday lives.</li>
      <li>individual self-expression and exploration.</li>
      <li>interactions and relations with others.</li>
      <li>interactions with and expectations of society and community.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We ground our discussion in established literature about non-digital self-expression and identity from the social sciences. This raises the key theme of individuals desiring control over how others see us, yet wanting to behave in a way that is authentic, or consistent with their internal identities. There is also emphasis on the collaborative and collective nature of identity formation; that is, our self-presentation fluctuates depending on the people we're with, the situation we're in, and norms of the society we're part of. The focus on face-to-face interactions and embodiment leads us to draw contrasts between online and offline experiences, and to look at the substitutes for the body in digital spaces.</p>

    <p>The extent to which online and offline identities interact and overlap is hotly debated. Is creating an online identity a chance to reset, to rehsape yourself as an ideal? Or are you simply using it to convey true information about what is happening in your daily offline life? Is it a shallow, picture of you, or a forum for deep self-exploration? How does the way one portrays oneself in digital spaces feedback to ones offline self-presentation? We explore these questions in <a href="#offline-to-online-and-back-again">section 3</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="#networked-publics">Section 4</a> examines social media and blog use, including how one's <em>imagined audience</em> affects self-presentation in public, and how <em>context collapse</em> might occur when the actual audience is different to expected. There are several examples of techniques for managing who sees which 'version' of oneself, and the types of 'versions' of self that are commonly seen to be constructed on social media, and with what degree of transparency they are linked together. Most of the longditudinal studies in this space are of teenagers and young people, who have never known a world without social media, and who may incorporate it naturally and seemlessly into their daily practices, thus making it a core part of their identity during formative years. I draw a contrast between the relationship-driven architecture of contemporary social networking sites, and the more personal, customisable blogging platforms which preceded them. Studies of bloggers and blogging communities reveal some different priorities and habits than what is common practice today, and offer insight into how online self-presentation is evolving.</p>

    <p>Throughout literature from both social and computer sciences, privacy is a common concern. In <a href="everybody-knows-im-a-dog">section 5</a> we look further at how tensions between users and the privacy settings of systems they use impact on personal information disclosure. Does self-censorship affect identity formation? How do people weigh up the risks and benefits of exposing themselves online? This is particularly pertinent for future systems development, as more and more people become aware of state surveillance, for-profit data collection, and their diminished rights over their personal data.</p>

    <p>Finally we introduce the relatively new Web Science concept of Social Machines in <a href="the-ghost-in-the-social-machine">section 6</a> in order to recapture the circular interdependencies between humans, technologies, and communities. We propose to build on current work of describing and classifying social machines to better account for the individual perspectives of participants.</p>

    <p>Ultimately we posit that online is simultaneously a reflection, a distortion, an enhancement, and a diminishment of the offline world. They impact each other in complex ways, particularly with regards to self-presentation and identity formation. The various theories and studies described in this chapter form the basis for which we conduct the investigative and technical work in the remainder of this thesis.</p>

      <div>
        <p>My perspective/bias... Reading all these studies from the last five to ten years about teens' changing attention, changing priorities, changing emotional states (or ways of handling it) due to technology, it occurred me to me they're talking about me (or is that narcissistic?). Some things I read are instinctively familiar; obvious. Some are ridiculous. How does my first-hand experience of growing up with technology affect my reading of studies, and my ability to study others?</p>

<section id="performing-the-self" rel="schema:hasPart">
  <h2>Performing the self</h2>
  <div>

    <p>The obvious place to start when embarking on a discussion about self-presentation is Goffman. In <em>The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life</em>, Goffman posits several, now well-established, theories:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Everyone is performing. The front-stage of our performance is what we create for others - the audience - to see, so that they may evaluate and interact appropriately with us.</li>
      <li>We also have a back-stage; how we act when there is no audience, or an audience of our <em>team</em>. Our team participate alongside and collude with on the front-stage.</li>
      <li>Our performances have both conscious and unconscious aspects. That is, we consciously <em>give</em> information about ourselves to others in order to manage their impression of us, but we also unconsciously <em>give off</em> information that others may pick up on and take into account when deciding how to interact with us.</li>
      <li>Both actors and audiences are complicit in maintaining the cohesion of a situation. Peformances break down if actors break character, deliberately or accidentally, or if there is a mismatch between parties' definition of the situation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>...</p>

    <p>Whilst Goffman's dramaturgy refers mostly to body language, a related theory is Brunswik's lens model [brunswick56, lens01], part of which suggests that individuals infer things about others based on "generated artifacts", or things left behind. In [bedrooms02] this model is used to study how personal spaces (offices and bedrooms) affect observers' assessments of the characteristics of the owner of the space. This study links individuals to their environments by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>self-directed identity claims (eg. purposeful decorations like posters or use of colour);</li>
      <li>other-directed identity claims (eg. decorations which communicate shared values that others would recognise);</li>
      <li>interior behavioral residue (ie. "physical traces of activities conducted within an environment");</li>
      <li>exterior behavioral residue (ie. traces of activities conducted outside of the immediate environment which nonetheless provide some cues as to the personality of the environment occupant).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These theories of course apply to face-to-face interaction.</p>


    <p>Embodiment... Self-presentation is largely unconscious in the physical realm and comes naturally the most people. People may also use in-crowd markers (like a shirt with a band logo on) consciously to send certain messages to people who will recognise them, whilst not drawing any attention from people who won't.</p>

    <p>... we later get to translating theories of identity which rely on embodied interactions or physical presence into digital spaces..</p>

      <p>Social psychologists argue that we come to know ourselves by seeing what we do and how others react to us, and that through interaction, actors seek to maintain the identity meanings associated with each role (Burke and Stets 2009; Cooley 1902; Mead 1934).  Indeed, Mead (1934) contends that for each role the actor plays, there is a separate Generalized Other, or larger moral understanding of who the person is and how the person is expected to be in the world, and that social actors manage their roles by adhering to disparate expectations as is situationally necessary. Similarly, Goffman (1959) demonstrates the skillful ways in which social actors reveal and conceal aspects of themselves for varying audiences, maintaining separate faces within distinct social arenas, while Leary (1995) discusses playing to each audience, their values, and their perceived positive opinion of the actor.</p>

      <h3>The self in context</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Development of personal identity is not only something that happens internally. We are strongly influenced by feedback (conscious and unconscious) from others around us, as well as the particular setting and culture in which we find ourselves. Thus identity is <em>socially</em> constructed, and often is adjusted according to <em>context</em> [@cites socsci via boydfacid].</p>

        <p><span class="notes">(self-awareness is identity situated as in society.)</span> A person's understanding of the context in which they are performing impacts their performance [boydfacid]. boyd argues that online, people find it much more difficult to evaluate this context, and thus run increased risk of performing inappropriately, or experience <em>context collapse</em> when multiple audiences are inadvertently combined. This is explored further in <a href="#growing-up-online">section 4</a>.</p>

        <p class="notes">…. political, cultural, racial. stuff about web dissolving these [@Turkle], but not really. [@Kenny] study about people using identity language (with a corpus of terms that corresponds to culture/society), but in content not wrt themselves or in their profiles.</p>

    <section id="extending-self" rel="schema:hasPart">
      <h3>Extending the self</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Early to mid 20th century philosophers and social scientists complicate notions of the 'self' by combining it and extending it with our physical surroundings, and this view emerged long before the Web. Heidegger expresses technology as coming into being through use by a human; when tools are used the tool and its user do not exist as independent entities, but as the experience of the task at hand (using the example of a carpenter hammering, unaware of himself or his hammer) [manhammer]. McLuhan discusses media, literate and electronic, from the printing press and electric light to radio, TV and telephone, and its impact on how we communicate. He places communication technologies as simultaneously extensions of and amputations of our bodies and senses, which continuously and fundamentally re-shape the way we (humans) see and place ourselves the world [mcluhan]. More recently, Clark's Extended Mind Theory uses the example of a notebook as a means of externally processing information that would otherwise be carried out by the brain, drawing the external world in as party to our cognitive processes [clarkmind].</p>

        <p>The next logical step is to consider how the modern digital technologies of Web and social networking can also be considered extensions of the self, and this is addressed in part by Luppicini's notion of Technoself [technoself]. 
        Technoself incorporates (amongst other things) extension of the self through physical technology embedded in the body (cyborgology); in our changing understanding of what it is to <em>be</em>, as life is extended and augmented through advancing healthcare; but also in our relationships with our virtual selfs. This is not a topic into which I will dive deeply from a philosophical standpoint, but the idea of the Web and online social networks as extensions to the self rather than as separate entities or concepts is worth bearing in mind as this thesis proceeds to explore the complexities of intertwined digital and offline identities.</p>

<section id="offline-to-online-and-back-again" rel="schema:hasPart">
  <h2>Offline to online… and back again</h2>
  <div>
    <p>When people use digital technologies to communicate, they are passing a version of themselves through the filter of the platform they use. One might assume that the disembodied nature of the interactions lets people have more control over how they are "seen" by others; Turkle claims that it is "easy" to create and tweak a perfect self online [@Turkle2016]. In reality this control is affected by a great number of factors. Turkle writes that computer-mediated communication is predictable even in the ways it is unpredictable, and that people seek out this predictability over face-to-face interactions in preference to facing emotional vulnerability. Perhaps in the early days of the Web the "nobody knows I'm a dog" meme rang true, but most of the social media systems in mainstream use at the time of writing are too large and complex for the average user to fully grasp the implications of their inputs. Turkle's argument assumes that we have full understanding and control of the digital systems we use and the audiences we are reaching through them. It presumes we know exactly how and where and when the data we input will be output in the short and long term, and how others will interpret it. One aspect of this is data <em>given off</em> by users as a side effect of scrolling, typing, tapping and clicking in their browser and mobile apps which is collected in the background by a plethora of third-parties. This generates a view of the individual that they may not even realise is being compiled, and over which they certainly have no control. Further, the affordances of the technical platform may dictate how a user is able to actively express themselves, or influence what they want to share on a subconscious level. We will discuss both of these issues in more detail later in this chapter.</p>

    <p>Turkle's argument also neglects that at every crossroad in these 'predictable' systems are stationed unpredictable humans, perhaps with conflicting interests and motivations, from conception to realisation and usage. Turkle has been studying for decades how people explore, experiment and find themselves through technology, and her overriding narrative is of a desire to express an idealised version of the self; one that is not subject to any interpretation other than what the expresser desires. However, as discussed further in <a href="#networked-publics">the next section</a> numerous studies of social media users find a variety of other reasons people use such sites.</p>

    <p>Keen [@keen2012] emphasises the risks that individuals become trapped by technology of which they have neither understanding nor control. Being swept up in cultural technology trends, social media users may unwittingly become "prisoners" of a carefully curated digital "hyperreality", the importance of which supplants their offline lives. Similarly, [inreallife] suggests that "fantasy gets in the way of real progress" when it comes to self improvement, but studies only examples of "catfishing", where individuals create exaggerated online profiles in order to deliberately mislead potential romantic interests. The idea that the online self <em>replaces</em> rather than supplements the offline self also misses the nuances of how and why people use social media in the first place. Nonetheless, we agree that online worlds are certainly not just a mirror of the offline.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, not only are online identities some form of reflection of offline identities, but the inverse can be true as well. In ethnographic studies of teenagers' use of mobile apps for socialising, it is reported that crafted online personas both reflect and feed back into teenagers' true sense of self [appgen]. Numerous studies from the field of psychology, reported in [infinitereality], demonstrate various ways in which playing a role online or in a virtual world reflects back and directly changes people's offline behaviour. Avatars can be used to build confidence and reveal suppressed personality traits. Relatedly, study participants who were asked to interact from behind avatars which conveyed different appearances of age, race, and body type expressed affinity with these previously unfamiliar experiences, and responded differently in personality evaluations before and after. I mention studies on this topic which relate specifically to social media use in <a href="#narcissism">section 4.3</a>.</p>

        <section id="narcissism" rel="schema:hasPart">
      <h3>Narcissism</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Constructing an ideal self, a facade. Social media often critiqued as encouraging narcissistic behaviour, especially with teens.</p>

        <p class="notes">The ease with which networks grow within this setting has re-set the meaning of network size such that very large networks are no longer status symbols or signs of popularity, but discrediting signifiers of narcissism and/or in-authenticity (Donath and boyd 2004; Ellison, Steinfield, and Lampe 2011; Tong, Van Der Heide, Langwell, and Walther 2008).</p>

        <p>Narcissism is not created buy the Web, but enabled by it, as a need for validation is more readily satisfied. [appgen].</p>

        <p>The flip side of this is that social media can provide self-affirmation or confidence reinforcement. This is show in several studies, including shown by [toma10], which explores the beneficial effects of browsing one's own Facebook profile; [nemer15] which discusses how selfies can empower marginalised communities; and [noland06] which finds a positive impact on self-esteem of teenaged girls who engage in "auto-photography".</p>

    <section id="authenticity" rel="schema:hasPart">
      <h3>Authenticity and integrity, dishonesty and deception</h3>
      <div>
        <p class="notes">Turkle. Keen.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Facebook founder Zuckerberg said that "having two identities for yourself is an example of lack of integrity" [fbeffect]. This received public backlash at the time, and on several more occasions as Facebook and other social networking sites imposed real name policies, sometimes linked to an official ID [boyd2012politics]. This removes a level of identity control which many people take for granted. A particularly clear example can be seen in the reaction of a community of drag queens who were used to being able to interact online using chosen names. Real name rquirements removes a vital aspect of fluidity from their interactions, glossing over the seams which provide poignant performance material and a route twoards a group identity [lingel2015face, barmann14drag]. Additionally the requirement for real names and the ability to report 'fake names' became a mechanism whereby a marginalised group could be harassed and silenced [hotmess2015selfies]. In general, an attitude that people should be happy to connect all of their identities together under a single legal name is an expression of social privilege, a result of having no features or proclivities which are socially censored.</p>

        <p>Sandberg, whilst COO of Facebook in 2012, commented that profiles as detailed self portraits is a "shift towards authenticity" [digitalvertigo], but her organisation's notion of 'integrity' as a single complete version of oneself that is the same no matter to whom one is presenting is somewhat at odds with authenticity. Neither are people "intraviduals", caught between competing identities as claimed by Conley in 2009 [conleyintra], but expression aspects of themselves appropriately and according to context. This is behaviour which we have already established via Goffman as ordinary offline, and so shouldn't be considered unusual online. Thus one's 'authentic' self-presentation may be partial or moderated and no less genuine for that. Indeed, some individuals find they are more able to express their authentic selves online than they are offline due to oppression or social expectations which are disjoint from their core values.</p>

        <p>Authenticity is disjoint with self-promotion, lying, micro-celebrity vs. authenticity is (in literature) always manufactured, idealized reality [Marwick2010]</p>

        <p class="todo">insert lit about authenticity online. Lit to do with dishonestly and deception.</p>

        <p>"strive to be honest and honerable" [inreallife]</p>

        <p>Popularity implies a reduction in authenticity, perhaps linked to 'selling out' or 'pandering' to an audience [donathboyd04, ellison07] and the idea of online spaces as under control of their owners suggests others may be suspicious of their authenticity [tong08]. However, not all that controllable...</p>

        <p>"Some argue that distinct contexts are unnecessary and only encourage people to be deceptive. This is the crux of the belief that only those with something to hide need privacy. What is lost in this approach is the ways in which context helps people properly contextualize their performances." [boydnp10]</p>

<section id="networked-publics" rel="schema:hasPart">

  <h2>Networked publics</h2>
  <div>

    <p>Social media technologies blur the boundaries between private and public, and this affects identity performance. Ten years ago, boyd hoped that educators and technologists would succeed in easing the cultural transition for young people into the networked era [<a href="#ref-boyd-sns07">boyd-sns07</a>]. She describes social networking sites as a type of "networked publics", technologically-mediated spaces where people can virtually go to interact with their friends, and where they may be subject to observation or interjection by passers-by. Differently to offline public spaces, online publics may be persistent, scalable, searchable, replicable, and/or have invisible audiences. These features of networked publics affect how people express themselves and interact, however they do not directly dictate participants' behaviour [boydnp10]. Networked publics are not only spaces, but collections of people or "imagined community"; different publics can serve different purposes, but cal also intersect with each other [boyd2014s].</p>

<!--     <p>"Networked publics must be understood in terms of “publics,” a contested and messy term with multiple meanings that is used across different disciplines to signal different concepts ... In short, I contend that networked publics are publics that are restructured by networked technologies; they are simultaneously a space and a collection of people ... My approach accepts the messiness and, instead, focuses on the ways in which networked technologies extend and complicate publics in all of their forms ... publics that have been transformed by networked media" [boydnp10]</p> -->

    
    <p>Over subsequent years, boyd and many others proceed to explore the effects of these differences on those who engage with online social media to different degrees. In this section I recount some of these studies and findings.</p>

    <p>First I reflect on the digital substitutions for the physical body in online social interactions. In comparing and contrasting 'old school' style blogging with contemporary (circa 2013-2017) social networking sites I look deeper into how differences in technological affordances impact peoples' interactions and self-expression. I also examine well known work on the negative effects of online networked publics, with regard to narcissism and authenticity.</p>
    <p>Audiences for identity performance as well as the context in which the performance takes place are critical, but online both of these may be unknown or dynamic, or both. I'll introduce work around imagined audience and context collapse, both of which pioneer our understanding of identity behaviours in networked publics. When audiences and contexts are known, we can examine how people connect with others and form communities; in the final section I look at trust, social reinforcement of identity, and studies of what social media participants choose to disclose or conceal.</p>

    <p class="notes">Unfortunately, networked publics appear to reproduce many of the biases that exist in other publics-social inequalities, including social stratification around race, gender, sexuality, and age, are reproduced online (Chen and Wellman, 2005; Hargittai, 2008). Political divisions are also reproduced (Adamic and Glance, 2005)" [boydnp10]</p>

    <section id="profiles-embodiment" rel="schema:hasPart">
      <h3>Profiles and embodiment</h3>
      <div>

        <p>In Faceted Id/entity [boydfacid], boyd highlights several differences between self-representation offline compared to online. Embodiment is a key factor in self-presentation and she claims that there is considerable difference between performing one's identity through appearance, eg. fashion and body language, when walking into a room, compared to explicitly describing oneself by entering attributes and other personal information into an online form to create a profile. The disembodied nature of online interactions means that people must find new ways to express themselves, and manage the impressions other people have of them. A lack of control over one's online self presentation is compounded by the inability to visualise - or perhaps even be aware of - the data that is collected by the systems we use. Online activities are logged over time to an extent that most individuals are not aware of; these activities, an individual's <em>expressions given off</em> (Goffman), are used, largely unknowingly, for the commercial benefits of third parties. boyd suggests that visualising all of one's personal information that is available online, as well as visualising one's 'audience' or social network connections, would provide an individual with better awareness of, and so better control over, their online image. In boyd's prototype interfaces, users are explicitly asked for personal data in order to build a profile of themselves, and boyd does point out the problematic nature of this, compared with the unconscious or implicit identity performance one conducts in offline social settings.</p>

        <p>Since boyd's prototypes were designed, social media gained widespread popularity. Most, if not all, mainstream systems request input of expicit personal data to build an initial profile, despite the discord of this activity compared with offline identity expression. However, unlike in boyd's prototypes, it doesn't stop there. Such systems encourage ongoing engagement through adding and messaging contacts with various degress of publicness, creating status updates to broadcast a current situation, production of creative media content, and feedback on content and updates created by others. As we will see in <a href="chapter3">chapter 3</a>, contemporary social media build one's profile from various combinations of these online activities, and typically use far more than the explicit data entered by the user to generate a representation of a person. This increases the likelihood that individuals may not have an accurate impression of what this representation looks like to others.</p>

        <p>Transparency of data collected, and control over how it is distributed is key to boyd's thesis of how to empower individuals online. Sadly, the situation here has not improved in the intervening years. Indeed, private corporations are collecting more and more personal data through free social networking sites, and granting the subjects zero rights with regard to access or distribution. Various data and surveillence scandals involving private companies and governments [dcent] that gained media attention mean that awareness of surveillence and personal data collection is growing amongst the general public. <a href="#everybody-knows-im-a-dog">Later in this chapter</a> we elaborate on how privacy concerns impact online disclosure and profile creation behaviours; in <a href="chapter3#social-media-makers">chapter 3</a> we build on the existing literature with an empirical study of a community of hackers intent on decentralised and personally-owned data storage as a means to greater control.</p>

        <!-- <p>Beyond simply visualising all of one's personal information, and the connections between social network contacts to show how personal data may flow through a network, boyd suggests that these visualisations can be used to actively segregate one's contacts along parameters which correspond to one's personal information, permitting an individual to perform identity more appropriately in digital spaces. However in practice, designing user interfaces for this proves to be challenging. For one, people aren't used to explicitly thinking about audience and context, so dividing their contacts up this way is not natural.</p> -->

        <p>[counts09] explores the impact of profile attribute selection on self presentation, and finds that upon completing the values for 10 attributes participants converge on their "ideal" representation of themselves. This study also finds that free-form attributes are better than ones with preset choices for participants' satisfaction with how they have portrayed themselves. This study does not take into account that most online profiles are created in a particular context, with a particular purpose in mind. Asking participants to express their ideal self-presentation 'in general' vastly oversimplifies reality. Participants are not told who the consumers of the profile they are creating are expected to be, nor do they indicate who their expected audience is or what they think the profile is for.</p>

      <h3>Social Network Sites</h3>
      <div>

        <p>In 2007 boyd and Ellison defined Social Network Sites (SNS) to be Web-based, bounded, public or semi-public, and afford creating and viewing connections with or between other users [boydsns07]. They note that users of these systems tend to connect with others with whom they already have a 'real life' social relationship, and present a fairly thorough history of SNS from 1997 onwards, which I won't recount here. This definition is pertinent to this thesis due to its emphasis on profiles as a core feature of SNS. In 2013 they updated their definition to incorporate different types of content and data into profiles; to de-emphasise the traversal of connections (as this became more important to machines than humans); and to emphasise participants' interaction with streams of user-generated content [ellison13]. I will proceed to focus on case studies and experiments which were carried out since these definitions, and due to the rapid pace of change in this area, priortise those from the last four years. I will revisit boyd's criteria for SNS at the end of this section.</p>


        <p class="notes">SNS have: profiles, friends lists, public communication, stream-based updates." [boydnp10]</p>

        <p>Many studies of identity formation on social media focus on young people and teenagers. One reason is because this is a crucial point in life for understanding oneself and asserting a personal identity. Other studies approach teenagers as somewhat alien "digital natives", born into a world of social technology which is expected to fundamentally change how they interact with the world compared with older generations, who don't or can't distinguish between online and offline<sup> [borndigi]. I will relate the results of these studies, but note that I disagree with the notion of a "digital native" because being born in a particular year or even raised around modern technology does not automatically give one a natural instinct for identity expression in digital spaces, and not even necessarily more opportunity to experiment and reflect than older SNS users [boyd2014s].</p>

        <p>Digital communication technologies can help or hinder identity formation. <em>The App Generation</em> [appgen] provides a balanced argument between the pros and cons of teenagers socialising through mobile applications. They find that some applications provide a "prepackaged identity" for users to adopt rather than encouraging experimentation. The affordances of applications shape the forms of expression that are available, and so identity formation is in a way controlled by the application designer. <em>Born Digital</em> [borndigi] suggests that teenagers experiment with identity online, but aren't fully aware, or don't care about, the traces that are left behind when they do so.</p>

        <p class="notes">A social network site is a networked communication platform in which participants 1) have uniquely identifiable profiles that consist of user-supplied content, content provided by other users, and/or system-provided data; 2) can publicly articulate connections that can be viewed and traversed by others; and 3) can consume, produce, and/or interact with streams of user-generated content provided by their connections on the site.</p>

      <h3>Blogging and personal homepages</h3>
      <div>

        <p>Retrospectively applying what we've learnt from studying social media use to how people were using blogs before? Similarities and differences.</p>

        <p>"homepages became an important site of identification, as early web users posted biographies, photos, and entertaining links for viewers who surfed to their page (Döring, 2002) [ellison13]"

        <p>Studies of blogging communities outside of the US demonstrate that blogging is not a uniform practice that can be understood as a whole [intlblog]. Certain communities (in this case, Muslim ones) which are seen by outsiders as homogeneous use blogging to highlight their uniqueness and individuality. Others (for example in China) emphasise their ethnicity and culture as a key part of their identity. Blogs from the Paris Banlieues in fact had a direct impact on how the mainstream media portrayed their plight; an example of how personal identity expression in networked publics was able to affect a broader social understanding of that identity. The overriding message from these studies is cultural taboos and offline societal context affect narrative about identity, and this is reflected online.</p>

        <p>Blogger has discretion over most parts of the blog. Commentary at a distance from one's own blog [intlblog].</p>

        <p>Through observations of over 200 blogs within a particular community and semi-structured interviews with 40 bloggers, [dennen09] identifies five aspects which affect how bloggers build their identity: name and blog title; descriptive attributes; post content; voice; affiliations; and visual design. All of these are subject to change over time, and sometimes major offline transitions can cause a shift to a new pseudonym or blog altogether; often the audience is invited along however. Blogs are often designed to reinforce community norms, to enhance a sense of belonging; as a result, the community develops and evolves its own identity, which in turn influences how newcomers choose to present themselves.</p>

        <p>"no clear entity either owns or defines the community as a whole" [dennen09].</p>

        <p>Blogging communities are traditionally more accepting of pseudonyms but [dennen09] notes that distrust is not of other community members, but rather of personally-known community outsiders who may accidentally stumble across blog entries.</p>


        <p>Identity is both individually and socially constructed. Identity expression through personal blogs is very individualistic; bloggers have traditionally had quite a bit of control over not only what they choose to share and write about, but how it is presented, organised and laid out. ..[@thatbloggingstudy] describes importance of themes and designs, and mentions that some people use a feed reader to subscribe but click through to the original post to read in context…</p>

        <p class="todo">judgements based on website appearances and stuff.. digital 'embodiment'</p>

        <p class="notes">Brunswick lens model used for digital; how observers make personality judgments about people based upon their personal Web pages [gosling08, markus06, vazire04, papacharissi02]</p>

        <p>Whilst bloggers (during peak blogging years like 2007) do collaboratively construct their identities through interactions with the community, they were mostly restricted to commenting on other people's posts. This fragments their contributions across different domains, and where their writing style and topics constitute a part of their identity, so it fragments their identity.</p>

        <p>Present day social media has dramatically increased participation in publishing and sharing online content [@citationeeded]. Easy-to-use services lower the barrier to entry for connecting with and pushing thoughts out to an audience. Identities expressed through social media are inherantly collaborative; every interaction is pushed to a network, and part of a dynamic cycle of consumption and creation feedback. Commenting on someone else's post automatically links it to your own profile, and often it appears there as well, accessible from two different contexts. Yet they permit little customisation, providing preset options for content or reaction templates, and consistent inflexible designs for profile pages. This tips the balance away from the individual aspect of identity construction, and differentiates current social media practices from a generation of bloggers who populated the web prior to the mainstream adoption of social media.</p>

        <p>"audience is critical to context" [boydnp10]</p>
        
        <p>On SNS, people are often expressing themselves to multiple audiences simultaneously. When people are aware of this, they take different strategies when it comes to navigating what they share; individuals with many followers on Twitter practiced self-censorship (only posting things they are happy for the worst-case audience to read) and practicing coded communication (strategically targeting some posts at some audience members, and others at others, to maintain overall interest) [Marwick2010]. However, given the many possible ways in which Tweets can be discovered and consumed ([Marwick2010] questioned people who post publicly) it is virtually impossible to determine the actual audience for one's content. Thus, people imagine who their audience is likely to be, and express themselves accordingly. Obviously these imaginings, which may stem from understanding of the affordances of a particular platform, or a particular community or topic of discussion, impact how people express themselves online.</p>
        <p>Relatedly, as people perform in networked publics, they must contend with a "networked audience," who are not connected only with the performer, but also with each other [Marwick2010].</p>

      <p><strong>From licloud paper background:</strong></p>
      <p>Deception has long been studied, both within and outwith the HCI community. Traditionally, deception has been cast in a negative light~\cite{bok1978lying}, to be used only if no other option is available. In the 1980s, however, communications researchers began to investigate the positive aspects of lying, in particular \emph{white lies}---socially acceptable lies which cause little or no harm to the recipient~\cite{camden1984WhiteLies}. </p>
      <p>In 1992, McCornack cast deception as an understandable response to complexity: ``[r]esearchers studying deception recently have begun to argue that deceptiveness is a message property that reflects a kind of functional adaptation to the demands of complex communication situations''~\cite{mccornack1009InformationManipulation}. People then manipulate the information which they share as a necessary part of participation in society. This has led to recent work on the positive aspects of deception in human computer interaction, in particular how `butler lies' are used to ease social situations~\cite{hancock2009butler}, and how systems can deceive their users for beneficial reasons \cite{adar2013Benevolent}.</p> 
      <p>The \emph{social} aspects of privacy relate to what DeCew terms \emph{expressive} privacy---a freedom from peer pressure and an ability to express one's own identity~\cite{decew1997pursuit}. Nissenbaum's contextual integrity~\cite{nissenbaum2004privacy,nissenbaum2009privacy} seeks to understand {appropriate sharing}, looking at the ways in which flows of information are governed by norms, which may easily violated as technological systems repurpose and share data.</p>

      <p>Several different taxonomies of lying and deceptive behaviours have been proposed~\cite{camden1984WhiteLies,depaulo1996lying,lindskold1983categories}; 
      Anolli et al. examined a family of deceptive miscommunications, including self-deception and white lies~\cite{anolli2001DeceptiveMiscommunication}. They look at \emph{omission} of relevant information, \emph{concealment} using diversionary information, \emph{falsifaction} and \emph{masking} with alternative, false information. Of particular interest is their claim that ``a deceptive miscommunication theory should be included in a general framework capable of explaining the default communication'', that is that deception should not be seen as a psychologically different activity than `normal' communication. This tallies with the earlier approach of McCornack~\cite{mccornack1009InformationManipulation} who situates deceptive messages within the spectrum of \emph{information manipulation}. This, combined with the lens of Gricean maxims, allows for an explanation of deceptions where some of the truth is told, but information which the speaker knows is relevant to the listener is omitted or obscured~\cite{grice1970logic}. 
      %From an economic point of view, Akerlof and Schiller~\cite{schiller2015Phishing} have described  deception in terms of the maintenance of asymmetries of information, and the exploitation of cognitive failings, biases and bounded rationality.</p>

      <p>Motivations for lying have also been extensively studied in social psychology. Turner et al.'s taxonomy included \emph{saving face}; guiding social interaction; avoiding tension or conflict; affecting interpersonal relationships; and achieving interpersonal power~\cite{turner1975information}. Camden et. al.~\cite{camden1984WhiteLies} develop a detailed categorisation of lies to do with basic needs, managing affiliation with others, self-esteem and miscellaneous practices such as humour and exaggeration. 
      A recent study of online behaviour found that the most common self-reported motivation for online lies was either to make one's life seem more exciting, or to downplay personal difficulties. Responses also included avoiding harassment and a range of creative endeavours alongside more clearly adversarial deceptions~\cite{kleek2015SelfCuration}.</p>
      <p>Another strand of research borrows from information warfare, to look at the possibilities for \emph{disinformation}.  Disinformation tactics are most useful when a channel of information cannot be completely closed, but can be rendered useless by being filled with incorrect, but plausible, assertions in order to lower its overall signal-to-noise ratio~\cite{wiki:disinformation}. The intended target of the lie may not be the official recipient of the message: lies can be directed at those who are eavesdropping on the communications channel or surveilling the participants~\cite{alexander2010Disinformation}. Techniques used include \emph{redaction} to remove parts of the message, \emph{airbrushing} to blur parts of the message and \emph{blending} to make the message similar to other plausible messages, as well as other forms of  \emph{information distortion}~\cite{alexander2010Disinformation}.</p>

      <p>We are rapidly moving into a world where information about nearly every aspect of our lives is becoming sensed, recorded, captured and made available in digital form. Data is captured and shared voluntarily, as tools invite ever more intimate participatory surveillance \cite{albrechtslund2008Participatory}. While the abundance of information traces has unlocked a wide range of new kinds of applications~(eg. \cite{Akker:2014:TRP:2684563.2684638} \cite{Consolvo:2008:ASW:1357054.1357335}), the creation and potential for disclosure poses new threats to individual privacy and autonomy. The overall lack of transparency by manufacturers regarding how they are capturing and handling personal information has created a heightened sense of unease among many, in addition to the potential threats dealing with their unintentional disclosure or misuse\cite{fife2012privacy, metzger2004privacy, featherman2010reducing}.</p>

      <h3>Deception in the age of pervasive surveillance</h3>
      <p>We are rapidly moving into a world where information about nearly every aspect of our lives is becoming sensed, recorded, captured and made available in digital form.  Increasingly, every app on our  smartphones, wirelessly connected devices in our homes, and on-body worn sensing devices are capturing what we do in unprecedented detail. Dodge and Kitchin \cite{dodge2005codes} introduced the term \emph{capta} to cover the data about us which are selected and captured as we go about our lives. In addition, vast amounts of data are captured and shared voluntarily, as tools invite ever more intimate \emph{participatory surveillance} \cite{albrechtslund2008Participatory}. While the abundance of information traces has unlocked a wide range of new kinds of applications~(eg. \cite{Akker:2014:TRP:2684563.2684638} \cite{Consolvo:2008:ASW:1357054.1357335}), the creation and potential for disclosure poses new threats to individual privacy and autonomy. The overall lack of transparency by manufacturers regarding how they are capturing and handling personal information has created a heightened sense of unease among many, in addition to the potential threats dealing with their unintentional disclosure or misuse\cite{fife2012privacy, metzger2004privacy, featherman2010reducing}. </p>

      <p>There is often an asysmmetry about the collection and use of data. To take a relatively prosaic example, Facebook introduced `read receipts' on messaging, which indicate when a user has seen a message. This feature has been shown to cause anxiety when present in email systems, as users seek to maintain their \emph{responsiveness image}, the impression which they project to others about how they respond to input and partition their attention~\cite{tyler2003can}. Once ambiguity about attention has been removed, a whole class of white lies---`The internet was bad, I couldn't check my messages'---are no longer possible, and people develop alternative strategies, such as not opening messages until they feel prepared to respond.</p>

      <p>The key difference in the context of social networks is that the user does not have the same degree of control over the channel---email receipts can be switched off, while social networks offer different levels of control.  In response, a spectrum of tools and practises have emerged to re-introduce attentional privacy in messaging systems (see Section \ref{sec:existing-tools}).</p>

      <p>Beyond sensing and storing this information, these apps and devices often disclose it, such as to the app or product's manufacturer's cloud data services, or to third-party companies and services for marketing and other purposes.  </p>
    
      <p>For those wanting to not be tracked, the two primary options available: try to suppress the amount of  information being shared, or discontinue their use altogether.  In practice, however, neither option is feasible or effective; first, the ever-increasing and varied ways people are now being tracked means that people are hardly aware of how they are being tracked to begin with.  For example, most end-users have little awareness of the information being captured about them by their smartphone apps~\cite{mylonas2013delegate, wetherall2011privacy}.   Second, many of the tools that track people are so vital to their everyday work or social activities that discontinuing their use is simply not practical~\cite{}  . Finally, suppressing or falsifying information given to services only works insofar as that information is both manually supplied and inessential to delivering the provided services.   Since people's greatest concerns surround information automatically sensed and captured, such as a person's physical location or activities, suppression may simply be impossible.   With the promise of further Internet-connected `smart'  sensors becoming increasingly invisible, the problem of even knowing where embedded in the  environment these devices are may simply become impossible.</p>
    
      <p>In contrast, a different strategy to suppressing information is the use of \emph{disinformation}, in which false information is strategically added to an information channel to discredit and draw attention away from true information that could not be suppressed~\cite{}.  Such strategies have been used heavily in wartime by various counterintelligence agencies in order to reduce the damage of leaked sensitive information~\cite{alexander2010Disinformation} \ToCite{CVDazzle? Similar stuff?}. While such measures may seem extreme, they are, the concept of disinformation is quite simple.  In this paper, we hypothesise that that, when applied selectively and appropriately in contexts, the use of disinformation, like other forms of deception, can be made to benefit end-users, system designers, and even those who are disinformation targets.  </p>

      <p>We are rapidly moving into a world where information about nearly every aspect of our lives is becoming sensed, recorded, captured and made available in digital form. Data is captured and shared voluntarily, as tools invite ever more intimate participatory surveillance \cite{albrechtslund2008Participatory}.

      <p>Many tools have been dedicated to helping people carry out various kinds of digital deception for the purpose of protecting their privacy. Without aspirations of comprehensiveness, we mention some here. Tools for masking identity are currently available for all levels of the software stack, from tools like \emph{tor} for masking the origin and destination at the network level~\cite{dingledine2004tor}, to privacy-enhancing features at the browser level.  Such browser features include \emph{Do Not Track}~\cite{tene2012track}, user-agent spoofing, and tracker and cookie-blocking capabilities~\cite{eckersley2010unique}.  At the application level, anonymous e-mail re-mailers~\cite{gulcu1996mixing}, anonymous e-Cash and cryptocurrencies~\cite{casale2015cryptocurrencies}, and anonymous secure file sharing systems~\cite{scarlata2001responder} have started to support certain activities offering guarantees of privacy under specified conditions.</p>

  <h2>The ghost in the (social) machine</h2>

    <p>Social Machines are systems for which the human and computational aspects are equally critical. In most cases, humans do the creative work whilst machines do the administrative tasks [@Timbl1999]. Up to now, systems have not been designed <em>to be</em> Social Machines; rather, the concept and definition of a Social Machine is derived from observations of existing (usually Web-based) systems. Many are products of the contemporary social web, on many different scales and in many different domains, often evolving, responding to technological and social developments, and interacting with each other [@Hendler2010, @ByrneEvans2013, @DeRoure2013, @Strohmaier2013]. Social Machines can be identified within and across social media networks, within and across online communities, and within and across technological spaces.</p>

    <p>Social Machines are pertinent to our work here as they provide a lens through which we can examine sociotechnical phenomena which emphasises the interdependence between humans and technology. In studies of social networks discussed previously in this chapter, humans are considered as <em>users</em> of systems, and discussions focus around how people react to technology, how people behave in the context of particular technical or social constraints, or how people's lives are changed in response to their interactions with and through digital environments. It is important to also reflect upon the ways in which technology evolves or is reconceptualised as a result of passive (mis)use and active (mis)appropriation by humans. We similarly must recognise technical systems in the wider context of society, and include in our dialogue the developers who design and build technical systems, the organisations and legal entities which finance and drive them, and the cultural and economic climate in which they are situated.</p>

    <p>Social Machines which have been studied so far have been described and categorised in terms of purpose [@DeRoure2013], motivations and incentives, technology used, goals and processes, quality assessment of outputs, and user participation and interaction [@Smart2014]. The emphasis in this work is on discussing Social Machines in collective terms; that is, 'a' Social Machine - wherever its boundaries happen to have been drawn (so far these boundaries are typically drawn around the edge of a "service" [@Smart2014]) - is considered as a coherent whole. The circumstances of the individual human participants not been given extensive consideration <em class="notes">TODO: barring.. update from 2014+ lit)</em>. For any given Social Machine, individual participants are diverse and participate in different ways, with varying goals, motivations and outcomes. As we have seen with through studies of social media mentioned previously, they manipulate their online presence(s) so that they may behave in different ways according to different contexts, or may work together to construct a single image controlled by multiple people [@Dalton2013]. Such behaviour impacts our understanding of roles, autonomy and awareness, incentives and attribution, and accountability and trustworthiness of participants. Overlooking unique individual perspectives when observing a Social Machine as a whole can cause incorrect assumptions, for example: believing that participants who lie about who they are have negative intentions in a Social Machine whose overall "purpose" is to strengthen social ties. We must also bear this in mind when designing systems, so that a system may grow in response to unexpected actions of participants rather than hampering their explorations.</p>

    <p>We argue that due to the complex nature of online identity, understanding nuanced individual behaviours of participants in a more granular way is crucial for Social Machine observation. We advance this argument in {part x} through an empirical study of a Social Machine centered around creative media production.</p>

    <p>...</p>
    <p>Along with their updated definition of SNS mentioned earlier, [ellison13] calls for social media scholars who are studying individuals or communities online to systematically describe the technology in which their participants are situated, and the practices of the users. Technologies are changing rapidly still, so studies which are a snapshot in time can be linked to a broader discourse or overview, and remain relevant as time progresses, if they situate themselves appropriately. One way of accessing this bigger picture is through an organising framework that helps to record the background state of the environment being studied, and so surfaces connections between work that is otherwise perhaps not directly comparable. In <a href="chapter3">chapter 3</a> I use several studies of my own on diverse identity behaviours across various social network sites in order to propose such a framework.</p>
