  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <div>
    <p>..</p>
    <p>This thesis covers a mere snapshot of a point in time, in the history of the Web and online social interactions. By the time you read this, anything labelled 'current' or 'modern' will probably be obsolete. Even in the last month of writing up, <em>Mastodon</em> took off, an implementation of GNU Social, decentralised microblogging platform designed to compete with the monolithic Twitter. If you were paying attention in Chapter 4, you know that GNU Social is the community takeover of StatusNet, which is based on a suite of protocols known as OStatus. The founder of StatusNet and the primary driver of the OStatus architecture, Evan Prodromou, is a chair of the Social Web Working Group. Following StatusNet, Evan worked on Pump.io, a popular instance of which includes <em>identica</em>. A modest community of developers maintain the primary Pump.io codebase and keep federated instances running. The Social Web Working Group's ActivityPub used to be called Activity<em>Pump</em>, and is an evolution of the Pump.io specification, with Evan's oversight. As such, the suddenly popular Mastodon codebase is not one but two generations of protocol behind, if we assume Evan (and Social Web Working Group co-conspirators) know what they're talking about.</p>
    <blockquote><p>
      "I'm happy for Mastodon's success but disappointed they didn't use the modern protocol ActivityPub we developed at W3C. All I have to say." - Evan Prodromou, on various social platforms [<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/evanpro/status/851155551325229058">Twitter</a>].
    </p></blockquote>
    <p>Already there are murmered complaints about the OStatus dependance on the <em>ancient</em> XML (developers these days supposedly prefer JSON). But how can we tell where this will go next? Does its sudden popularity (at a scale not previously enjoyed by decentralised social efforts) mean that after all, the Social Web Working Group's efforts were for naught; OStatus was sufficient all along, it just needed the timing of the current political environment perhaps combined with the (comparatively) beautiful user interface that Mastodon provides? Or does it mean that thanks to its popularity, a flurry of open source developers will update the codebase to be compatible with ActivityPub, and the Working Group's work will see widespread success off the back of Mastodon after all?</p>
