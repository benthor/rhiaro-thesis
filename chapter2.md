# The Presentation of Self Online

The main goal of this chapter is to cover previous work and empirical evidence of how people present themselves, as a basis for better supporting them.

* Social sciencey and web sciencey background literature
  * Goffman
  * boyd
  * Turkle (2nd half of Alone Together)
  * whilst there will be other lit reviews in other chapters, this is the foundational one of the thesis and will take up most of this chapter probably.
* Brief empircal analysis of creator profiles (SOCM14)
* Deception as a tool for social impression management online
  * Lying survey
  * lieCloud case studies

## Braindumping

Reading all these studies from the last five to ten years about teens' changing attention, changing priorities, changing emotional states (or ways of handling it) due to technology, it occurred me to me they're talking about me (or is that narcissistic?). Some things I read are instinctively familiar; obvious. Some are ridiculous. How does my first-hand experience of growing up with technology affect my reading of studies, and my ability to study others?

## Social machines braindumping

Identity in social machines. How to explore identities when part of a crowd? Reputation in a coordinated whole needs consistency and reliability. Apps as tools for individuals, vs/and tools for social coordination.

In the same way apps restrict users, how might social machines designed with some purpose inhibit users? How can we build social machines with space for exploration and innovation by participants? How crucial is self-presentation of participants for this?


# Reading notes (to condense)

## digitalvertigo

### AJ Keen 2012

Solitude is important and impossible.

Expectation of self surveillence is harmful and devisive. He asks, for those who prefer solitude, will they cease to exist?

"Publicness grants immortality" - Public Parts, Jarvis 2011

Facebook makes CIA redundant, cites The Onion.. => what exactly does CIA care about? not your breakfast.

Employers and colleges checking social media (33)

Lots of references to social/search services that are dead now ^^

1984 ownlife

Reid Hoffman - 'transparency rewarded integrity' = Trust economy

Jarvis - publicness will result in more tolerant society (52)

Keen - not. 'open architecture often encourages thos ecompletely lacking in integrity to wreck the reputations of innocent people'

Dalton Conley - intraviduals. Caught between completing identities (<=== BS)

Reputation, competition, actually isolates us as we compete for others' attention. "cloud of glory" - Tresch (119)

Reinvention

Panopticon prisoners - reduced from human beings with their own lives into packaged timelines of processed information (146)

hyperreality - the completely real becomes completely fake.

Imagine a hotel that's a prison - a place that incarcerates us without knowing it (149)

...Turning us into... (179)

forget who we are, what it is to be human (192)


## In Real Life

### Nev Schulman 2014

People creating fake identities to escape. Idealised versions of themselves so people will treat them differently. (Or, to exploit others).

Says this results in people hiding from, rather than dealing with, actual problems. Like portraying yourself how you like online is a bad thing. Usually negative repercussions for you and the people you mislead. Reasons: appearance, sexuality, control, fear, addiction, fantasy.

"fantasy gets in the way of real progress" (42)

==> thinking about 'deception' profiles from the 'hopefuls' perspective.

"we feel safer behind the screen" (89) Less social since no physical.

"we all lie online to varying degrees" (95) => Surveys

"online culture of dishonesty"

"the way you are perceived seems so much more important than what you actually are" (97)

"It should go without saying that we should strive to be honest and honerable in everything we do and say, online and off." (106)

Employers and colleagues googling you and examples (116)

"in the future, everyone will want their 15 minutes of anonymity" (122)

127 - 'rules' for online dating profile, all about honesty but not too revealing.

## Infinite Reality

### Blascovich & Bailenson 2011

"dozens of psychological experiments have shown that..." peoples' avatars affect their IRL, ie. confidence, exercise. (4)

==> this opposes Nev In Real Life

Avatars: "completely anonymous but inherantly traceable"

What is reality?

Convincingness of VR

actual, implied and imagined presence of others - Gordon Allport

Important in VR is belief a person holds about a representation.

Theory-of-mind

Virtual contexts bring different norms and expectations (81)

People behaving differently based on uniforms/colour clothes. Self-perception -> unconscious behaviour (102)

Comparison of avatars with clothes.

Turkle 1995 - playing with unexplored aspects of self (103) turkle quote

How avatar changes behaviour

Nick Yee thesis: EverQuest + WoW self-presentation (104) -> effects of virtual on IRL found (107) "their virtual presence carried over to the physical realm and they did not feel the need to exaggerate"

"role playing... has consequences... for behaviours carried over into the physical world" (114) Age, obesity, race

"the notion of self is fluid in virtual reality" (120)

Scenario where virtual avatar programatically behaves differently to different people (124) Experiment with students engagement with teacher in classroom improved when student thought teacher was making eye contact with only them (but was with all) (128) And scenarios with other students attentive or distracted.

Secondary avatars, semi-controlled to do tasks in games (153)

How do we know who is behind/controlling an avatar (/profile). Agents. 'Hidden cameras' of virtual reality (155)

==> Dmitri Williams - social science methods to study virtual worlds. (160)

==> Sandy Pentland reality mining

Digital footprints to detect liars, psychosis, leadership... @no way to hide the fact that one is a dog" (168)

"even the roles we play are up for grabs in virtual reality. Avatars can reveal sides of people they themselves never knew existed." (260)

## App Generation

### Gardner & Davis 2013

=> Davis thesis blogs identity youth Bermuda

Three Is - identity, intimacy, imagination - have been reconfigured by apps

Teens crafted online persona ~ true sense of self (feed into each other)

Facebook relationship status option s- "give rise to new forms of imaginative expression... application shapes and restricts these expressions in distinct and distinctive ways" 6

=> "An 'app' or 'application' is... tightly controlled by the individual or organisation that designed teh app." 6

Weird idea that if there isn't an app for something it doesn't matter 8

App-enabling vs app-dependant 10

5 year study 150 young people in New England and fewer in Bermuda. 7 focus groups with 6-10 adults who have worked with young people for >20 years. 40 interviews with high school teachers. Compared student art (writing and graphics) gathered over 20 years - how changed.

Need to consider how earlier technologies like telephone defined youth 13

Proposes that generations may be defined by dominant technologies (=> too fast!)

Componants of technlogy: tools and machines, information, media, human psychology.

McLuhan alert 22 Each medium, extension of human sensory organs, alters relation of individual to the surrounding world.

Devices more personal - control over what is sent and received - compared to radio and TV (=> compare to who controls apps though?)

'The paradox of action and restriction' 24

"Can constitute a challenge - asking us what we can accomplish despite these restrictions" 25

"wrt identity formation: Apps can short-circuit identity formation, pushing you into being someone else's avatar - or, ... they can allow you to approach identity formation more deliberately, holistically, thoughtfully." 32

"prepackaged identity", "endless role diffusion"

Pro tech - danah, Cathy Davidson, Henry Jenkins, Shirky, David Weinberger.

Anti tech - Nicholas Carr, Mark Bauerlein, Cass Sunstein, Sherry T, Janen Lamien(?)

"we believe more and more young people are app-dependant than app-enabled" 45

Young people expressing consistency between online and offline selves 63

But online is often a 'polished' version. Not one-to-one. Youth interviwed said online identity is 'less complete' than offline 64

Sometimes due to constraints of platform. More common - privacy.

"Do apps open up or constrain identity expresson?" 66

"The standard elements of a profile on facebook... are used to package the self for public consumption" 71 "Presentation and performance are also central on YouTube"

Narcissism - constant need for support/validation/self-assurance, enabled by web. But young people less secure and more risk-averse, hopeless.

Identities with religious communities lessened; young people identify with multiple groups "sympathies are distributed" More accepting of diversity. 87

Access to wider range of online communities means niche identities don't have to be set aside to fit in 90 - enabling

"apps to augment or replace offline relationships?" 110

Responsibility on parents and app developers to steer towards enabling over dependant.

## Born Digital

### Palfrey and Gasser 2008

Obviously dated. Addressed to old people who are scared of da youts.

Explains how 'digital natives' are so vastly different then goes on to say how they're not different at all. That's okay I suppose.

Online enables fluid experimentation with identity but also keeps a record so identities are traceable.

"Digital natives almost never distinguish between the online and offline versions of themselves", "multiple representations inform her overall identity"

=> Identity management = multiple presentations of self on facebook DiMiccio and Miller - says should build tools to support bridging communities.

=> Youth, Identity and Digital Media

=> Huffaker and Calvert, Gender Identity and Language Use in Teenage Blogs

=> Calvert - Identity Construction on the Internet

"changes are far greater for social than for personal identity"

Reward vs risk of self-disclosure. Young people understimate risks. 25

"The structural design of online platforms both constrains and builds upon these means of building networks of identity and trust"

=> Still quite a lot of focus on the visuals of avatars, 'controlled' by user, like wearing a mask. I suppose that's the most obvious way of telling ifn someone is trying a new 'identity' if they design an image for themselves that physically different. 'Virtual worlds'

34 "can adjust her digital identity with ease, but has far less ability to control how her identity is percievied by others", "she appears to have much more control over her identity but in fact she has much less"

"more bound to a single identity"

"identities might converge... even more than identities ever converged before the digital era."

"...created multiple identities... might be connected to create a much fuller picture of the individual... spanning a greater period of time."

36 "Most digital natives have an instinct about... identity expression an dformation in a digital age"
