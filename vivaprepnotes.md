Start with some studies and how they're good but how they fail to consider certain things. Find an example for each of the 5Cs if possible. Studies try to measure correlations and causations, but they miss factors because they aren't considering a wholistic picture. Also point out we have a fairly well accepted base from social science, that lots of people don't consider. danah boyd is good at it, and a few others, but here is also where they fall short. When we tie studies like this to specific systems, that is good, we need that recorded and they often can't be generalised away. But it also dates them. A framework can help with understanding other things that change/stay the same as the system changes.


We explore the space with observational studies. Diverse scenarios, from regular social media use, to divergent use of regular social media use, to use of less common social media environments. Each of these studies highlights a particular set of themes which paint a picture of particular part of the landscape of online self presentation.

We use these themes to assemble a hopefully more complete picture, which forms the 5Cs framework.

Assumptions: decentralisation as the future. So how does decentralisation change things about self-presentation?

First, this is an emerging/evolving space. I want to get ahead of it, so we don't ruin peoples' lives like current social media does. The other stuff was protocol development. My involvement in SWWG was co-editing one spec, contributing significantly to another, implementing several of them, but most importantly, maintaining an overall view of the work in the space which results in a WG Note providing guidance to current and future developers of decentralised social stuff.

Talk through SWP in terms of 5Cs.

This is grounds for the beginning of some experimentation, but nothing conclusive. Personal Web Obsv. FACE.

Maybe I should reorder this. Go from 5Cs to the current bleeding edge, demo some stuff. Talk about problems to be solved, then backtrack to how swwg is solving them.
